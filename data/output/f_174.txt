 - December 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4&&&Worth every penny&&&Of all the apps I've ever downloaded this is the only one that continues to stay on my device. It has never failed me and doesn't even ask for permissions. It just works and has all the features I would ever ask for.
 - February 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4&&&Best one&&&I've used this everyday now for the past 6 months and it has never failed me.  LOVE IT! -DROID X & RAZR MAXX
 - January 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.4&&&I love this app!&&&I have set up eight or so alarms. Most days I don't use any, but for those "can't be late" events, I can quickly activate AlarmDroid.  Highly recommended!
 - May 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4&&&Works really well on galaxy s&&&I love the shake to turn off and flip to snooze feature, the weather update and custom wake up message. Highly recommended.
 - December 29, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.4&&&Great way to wake up but&&&Good Morning will work better for me with the full screen snooze button and 2nd stop/snooze countdown screen than Alarm Droid with snooze and stop buttons on same screen.
 - March 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4&&&The BEST alarm clock by a mile. 5* All day long !&&&ICS Bug (turning alarm off put phone into Silent/Vibrate mode) seems to have 'gone away/been fixed' now - without any feedback from Dev whom I contacted several times via email & website (netpurist)
February 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 1.4&&&Well worth pro jst to not see ads. Nice alarm works for me. Hardly ...&&&Well worth pro jst to not see ads. Nice alarm works for me. Hardly ever late. Choose mp3: )

June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.4&&&Pay the man!&&&After using the free version I felt like my most reliable app should cost something.  Thank you goes out to the programmer for offering such a great app for free.
 - June 4, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4&&&Crap&&&Was decent until they added ads in pro version, now in order to remove adds from payed version you need to send him more money via donate button and you will get a new code to disabled the new ads
 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4&&&This is THE alarm clock to have&&&Been using free version on tablet for over 6 months with almozt no trouble (small glitch with the solve arithmetic problem feature self activating & not wanting to shut off when solved but self corrected next alarm cycle a couple times).  Makes a plug in clock look like a unicycle compared to a car! Pay for this program, it's inexpensive at 10 times the price & worth every penny!
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.4&&&Actually does what I want&&&I tried several alarm apps and hated them all. Thus one, however, is awesome.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4&&&Brilliant&&&Great app,  the only thing that would make it better for me is the option to start using obstacles only after snoozing for x minutes/times,  that's nitpicking tho, I can accomplish this by setting up two alarms.
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.4&&&Great, but...&&&Global weather format option for fahrenheit vs celsius doesn't update scripts for voice alarms.    Also, would be neat to see widget switch for individual alarms.  Really very brilliant app for the sleeper who needs their awakening to be "just so."
