 - June 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Great update.&&&The contact shortcuts freeze after a while but everything else is brilliant. All the previous issues seem to be resolved. Just needs an option not to use icons that come with themes and it would be perfect. Great update. Problem is my HTC one v struggles to run it.
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Nicely done!&&&Super smooth, responsive and quick. The 6/12 update brought live wallpaper support AND resizable widgets--something I think we've all been waiting for.Just wish the load times were decreased. Also, still having issues reloading my backed-up configurations. But otherwise, thanks guys! It's coming along, slowly but surely. Really a great launcher now :)
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Overpriced but awesome&&&Not sure it is worth the price but I love it. If they keep adding to it, it could easily be the best
 - June 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Good App&&&I really like this home replacement but I'd like to see some transition effects on the home pages and maybe some free themes I don't want to spend even more money after buying this and the 3D music effect doesn't work for me, also may be some different animation props.
 - June 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Good&&&But lacking some aspects from the video. Please fix. Like the flag thing.
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Functionallity and Flare&&&Aesthetically very pleasing and functionally straight forward. If there ever ends up being an Android Dev H.O.F, I am calling for TSFUI to be the initial inductie.  P.S. devs: let us hide apps in the main drawer and TSF Shell will be PERFECT!
 - June 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Great app but!!!!&&&Needs to fix restarting I had to back up everything, when I did the back up a lost my Widgets so I needed Starr all over again. NEEDS FIXING ASAP!!!!!!!
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Amazing UI&&&This is the best app out there.  UI is smooth and I have had no flaws whatsoever! The only thing I can't figure out is how to get the map widget on my sidebar!  Still a five star rating in my book!  HTC evo 3d
 - June 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Beautifully deceiving&&&Amazing launcher, but jaw-dropping power consumption ruins its usability. I have an extended battery on my HTC Resound, and within a few hours with light use my phones life was down halfway, something that never occurs. Please fix this and I will use TSF regularly.
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Not bad&&&Has a nice UI, but I don't think it's worth $17. I would also expect more updates more often for the price that's charged.
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Love it!&&&Been using it since day one, and I absolutely love it!  Just put Jelly Bean on my phone this morning.  TSF crashes when I long press an icon to move it, every time.  Can't blame TSF, as this Jelly Bean isn't officially from Verizon, but you might want to look into it as I can find no other fault with Jelly Bean.  Keep up the awesome job!
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Keep going&&&Much much better now, keep the great work!! But: Live wallpaper slides strangely too slowly, & widgets still occasionally become invisible, & contact widget responds very poorly, or does not respond at all.
 - June 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Thanks for taking my suggestion&&&For home button going to drawer when at home. You should mention that in the update list though. :D Still needs auto rotation.
 - June 23, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Better! but....&&&Every time I think this is a great product I am reminded how beta it is. I've been using it since day one and each update offers Improvements, but they are not often enough to offset the frustration of using it. It force closed and all customizing was gone. Tried to restore and all it restored was blank screens. No more for me. Weeks of getting it the way I like then it's gone to start hours of reloading it. Goodbye tsf.  Hello again spb. Still fc and at least 10 reloads a day. Please just make it stable.
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&widgets scroll CHOPPY&&&Great updates!!   the scollable widgets finally works, but the animation is choppy and jerky.. plz fix TNX, and keep up the great work
 - June 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&folder issue&&&Swiping on a folder now brings up the lasso instead of 'dragging'  out the contents.  I really liked this feature,  is it a bug? Also pressing on widgets cause the shell to reload
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Now working again - thanks&&&Had problems with update causing a forced close when trying to open. Emailed developer and reinstalled today and now working perfectly. Good job. Good have it up and running again and being even better
 - June 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Good update...but!&&&Thanks for the update, but instead of working on organising apps alphabetical, wheres the map tab we all have been waiting for? Add one star, but still needs work!
 - June 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Problem!&&&3 star for now, but defo could earn a 5, having problems with widgets.. when i go into settings of a widget and then back out, it comes up "tsf is loading", even when i add my own widget like "multi Toggle" when i click to turn on wifi it doesnt just turn on it loads tsf again :( same with the brightness... love the launcher though and would defo be a high 5 if the widgets worked correct :)
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Features and eye candy abound!&&&This launcher is the best looking one out there! The UI is a bit different from the other launchers out there, but the learning curve isn't much at all.   I have used just about every launcher for Gingerbread, and find this one to be the best looking and best functioning so far. I've paid the $14.95 for SPB Shell and the $3-$4 dollars for Launcher Pro and ADW Launcher EX. I was very hesitant to pay the $16.80 for TSF, but after finally taking the plunge, I am not disappointed in the least!
 - June 30, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&HTC one x&&&I have stuck with this since release, now can't apply widgets +constant restarting. Tried not using lwp, had to restart the launch hence lost all widgets hence found out I can't reapply them. Love & have given my full support to this launcher, time to say enough is enough. If you are contemplating purchasing.. Don't, at least not yet.
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Getting there....&&&The launcher is amazing and love the quickness about it but would give it 5 stars if they update is regularly and give new features to it such as more widgets like clock, calender, notes and other widgets.... Also want some new animation features and maybe a lock screen of their considering the price we have for this we should get all the above mentioned and even more but so far so good
 - June 30, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Is It So DIFFICULT !!!&&&It's so ridiculous that a DEV who creates such a complex launcher is not able to add a simple piece of technology called "auto-rotate" function ! It's such a basic feature but it seems we have to wait till version v2.5.0 for this simple amenity !!!
 - June 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Scrolling widgets have issues&&&Good app. But if scrolling widgets are not ancored to the top of the screen then they randomly freeze. Kinda small bug for something that costs 17 bucks. Stick with spb for now folks.  also should add on icon email count support. This is something other launcheds have for $1.99
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&galaxy tab 7.7&&&please add auto rotage feature and not slide wallpaper option
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&An Excellent Launcher!&&&I used Go Launcher for years. Bought this on day 1, & it's come a long way. Developers have finally made a launcher that surpasses anything on the market. Believe me when I say "This launcher is FAST & SMOOTH!" Thanks TSFUI. You've perfected it!  Absolutely the best launcher available!   Should be rated "Six Stars!"
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Hand down best launcher. Runs smooth on GNEX&&&Now it is a a bonified full launcher replacement. Don't let the price scare you. These developer's are great they won't release something until it's PERFECT witch I wish more where like that. So there is some time between releases but every irritation is always an improvement and always has at least one WOW addition to it. This last update made this my favorite app hands down for Android!
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&The BEST launcher EVER!!!&&&I was thinking of rating this app about 4 stars. However after the latest update 1.50 beta I changed my whole mind. 5 Stars!!! This is much better than iOS and ICS or ginger. I think any launchers out there cannot compete with this launcher. ( just letting you know, you gotta get used to it first before judging yourself about this launcher ;-)) This launcher keeps updating and provides us with unbelievable features that I have not yet experienced in iOS or other launchers. It is worth purchasing!!!
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Great update! Improved smoothness + bug fixes.&&&This latest update made the launcher pretty much flawlessly smooth, no matter how many widgets / home screens you are using. Really nice optimization work.  Also, launcher redraw after exiting stock Music player has been fixed. This has been bugging me for months. Thank you for this vital fix and I am sure there are others I will discover.
 - June 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Its ok....&&&Could be the best launcher yet!! But it cant do half of the stuff it shows in the video!! 5 stars when it can.
 - June 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG myTouch Q &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Good update&&&Seems like its missing something though. I feel like I've hit a plateau with all these features. Maybe an ability to merge themes or be able to change all the icons, instead of having a bunch of outcast icons that developers left out. Nobody enjoys half a theme.
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Galaxy S 3&&&Excellent home launcher, but on android pro widget "facebook" it is slow when i scroll up or down even on google+.... please try to fix it.
 - June 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Great launcher.&&&Great app. But could you add the ability to hide unwanted apps?
 - June 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Sidekick 4G &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Still no live wallpaper&&&Its better than it was but still no live wallpaper working on sidekick 4g
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Was initially hesitant but this is great. Worthy of the hype during its ...&&&Was initially hesitant but this is great. Worthy of the hype during its development. Needs lasoo tool lock and more widgets though.
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Great launcher!!!&&&Take the time to look in the help section before you start crying! I actually have this,go,adw... this one is slowly taking the top slot!
 - June 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Great start!&&&Allow more apps in scrollable  folders. Also seems to restart a lot when trying to multitask by pushing the home button. This started before v1.5.0. I paid $17 for this app. I get more useful updates from Go Launcher and it's free!  HTC inspire 4g.
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Love it&&&Love it so far. scrollable widgets still don't work with external widgets
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Brilliant&&&So glad I stumbled upon this app. Only problem is I can't do the flag thing for Google maps
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Awesome&&&Fantastic smooth launcher. Chosen home screen (respond to home key) keeps changing
 - June 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Absolute crap, refund?&&&Worst launcher I have had the displeasure to use at £10.52 the most expensive. Awkward menus, phone, messages, contacts and applications aren't even available at all times on the screen. Home screen is just a big mess of all applications installed. Weather add on crashes. I now deleting, and don't believe the hype... Avoid
 - June 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&ISSUE and ....sad feeling!!!&&&Unfortunately ...there is an issue which has to be fixed DEFINITELY !!!! After lots of time of use, I figure out that ....(unfortunately) your launcher makes a lot of reloads or restarts !! After web surfing and go back to launcher there is a reload ...any time!!! Also after searching on market and back ...same issue!!! Plus in many more cases!!! This is really BAD.Plz fix this, also A request for hiding notification bar and icon labels
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Galaxy nexus&&&I cannot use some options on v1.5.0 beta
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Excellent&&&Best launcher ever on android system
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&It's a great App. But.....&&&It's a great App. But everytime reload TSF Shell, the default home will be back to Drawing App. I have to set it again everytime after reloaded.
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&??YAY!!!! AWESOME UPDATES ??&&&Fantastic additions,  runs smoothly, fluid interface, super options, outstanding interface and just plain Fun;) Gobs of ingenuity and creativity.... The beginnings of greatness! Love love love love can't wait to see what's next!
 - June 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&-.-&&&Nice update, the gallery is awesome, but the most important thing that I was waiting for was the compatibility with live wallpapers. Finally it is compatible! BUT... works horrible when you turn it on! if you use a live wallpaper the performance goes down a lot, everything moves with a horrible lag. I mean, comon man! you are a wonderfull dev, I pay a lot for this app and I don't regreat it, but I use a Motorola Atrix, 2 cores, 1gb of RAM, you can do something better! (with the live walls).
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Best launcher that I've used so far!&&&I've gone through several launchers: Go Launcher, Nova, SPB Shell and now TSF. Which one do I prefer? TSF without any hesitation. I was on the bubble about purchasing this launcher for $16.80 considering I purchased SPB Shell for $15 several months ago, but after playing with it, I don't think I can ever go back to any of the above named launchers. SPB has a lot of eye candy but after the novelty wears off, there really isn't much functionality to many of it's features.  TSF on the other hand has features that are unique yet add that add sense of real world functionality to the UI (I'm loving the "lasso" function). The screen transitions are buttery smooth. No lag on my galaxy S2 Skyrocket and this is by far the smoothest running launcher I've installed yet. I see some real potential here if the dev's keep improving it and add more features. It appears to be updated regularly unlike SPB which takes months before any updates. I'd like to make a recommendation to the dev's regarding the notepad widget. I'm hoping you add the option to type something on the notepad rather than draw. Other than that, keep up the great work! Your last update nailed it!!
 - June 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&It's great but...&&&I just can't get live wallpapers to work on my phone. I'm using an HTC Amaze 4G with ICS.
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Smooth but lacks basic functions&&&Like home button,  scrolling simply by left,right between pages.  But very nice UI and its fast.
 - June 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Back in action.&&&Need option to remove side dock/panel
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Darrell&&&The latest update made everything perfect for me.  The options you added were spot on.  Also, battery consumption seems to be much lower than other launchers.  Didn't mind the cost considering all the benefits.
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Black & Silver Evo 3D&&&Well worth the money.  My patience paid off cause it's pretty close to perfect.  Maybe there will be color changing theme capabilities built into the next update so we won't have to wait for themes to be created, we can just enhance current ones.
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Still in love with this...but...&&&Ever since I purchased this shell it's worked flawless, but I'm still waiting for that nifty lil' map widget. I think it's time you guys cough it up & let us what this baby really can do!
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Update&&&You would have 5 stars but you should not take this long to update. "Coming Soon" doesn't mean take 2 months, and when people pay this much, much free launchers should not be updated 3 times more often than you.
 - June 27, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Disappointed&&&Good features, BUT, you can't tell if the application is going to launch because there is no click sound indicating that you touched the icon. Might be a deal breaker for me if I have to wait and see whether the app will launch, not knowing because I didn't hear a click. SENT IN SUGGESTION OVER A MONTH AGO, but guess the developers didn't think it was that big of deal.
 - June 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Great launcher, but needs icons&&&I love this launcher but it needs better icons, hopefully some one can build a icon pack for this launcher. I also think it would be better if we could control the number of pages on our screen and the semi circle button on the left should function as an app launcher...then it would be by far a 5 star rating  *****
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Really Nice&&&This is the most unique and fun Launcher (its more than that ) on the market. I like having a phone that is totally different than any other. I did have a reset and I hope that doesn't continue, so keep the updates coming. 4 stars till I know there are no rearrange or forced close.
 - July 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Love it!!&&&Great eye candy launcher. I can't seem to find a way to get the map flag and other flags that are seen in the video. Other than that no complains, except for the price. Its a great launcher.
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Best!&&&Best launcher on the market!!! Devs are also the best on the market!!!
 - June 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Good job&&&Keep it up, still waiting the map and the new music player...would be give 5 star if more widget is coming such as calendar ,clock,etc...
 - July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Awesome&&&Has improved so much since when I first downloaded this. I message widget would be awesome, and more animation/ props would be cool besides the Halloween ones.
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Tsf launcher&&&Best launcher on the market. Hands down. Worth every penny.only thing it is lacking is a task killer widget
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Pretty good but...&&&...it would be nice if you.could hide apps from the app page and if you could disable the screen loop. ..and some new animations
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Nice update!&&&Nice improvement over first release. Had one force close. Adding additional transition effects to widget screen scrolling would me nice. Thanks for the update.
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&LUV DA UPDATES!!!&&&KEEP THEM COMING. MAKE SUM THEMES FREE PLS
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&FINALLY!&&&Finally perfect. THANK YOU JEEBUS!    Though I would like the ability to hide apps on the apps pages.  Otherwise, fantastic!
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Dx&&&Getting better... I still waiting for the map update
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Beautiful!&&&Love how this looks and works, so slick and unique. Getting close to perfect now, but would like to see options to lock the screen layout and hide the notification bar.
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Just wow.&&&Dont be scared of the price trust me you will absolutely love this launcher. So many features and the smoothest launcher I've ever used on my Galaxy Note.  Great work tsfui team.
 - June 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia S &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Excellent&&&good
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Minor Issue&&&Bought this when it came out. It's come a long way. My only real gripe is that if you set one of the extended screens as your home screen, that setting is lost upon reboot. Please fix.
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Awesome&&&Best launcher! :-)
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Love it !&&&Most advanced and Flawless launcher. I've already used the Rest. Really! Tho I believe this is the Best.. Totally worth the Buy. Enough said :)
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Smoooth&&&This is actually better than all the other launchers and indeed very very silky smooth. But not quite sure it is worth just over £10?
 - June 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Don't buy&&&Soes not do what it says
 - June 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Awesome Launcher&&&Run smooth on my Samsung infuse 4g

 - July 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Great but need improvement&&&By considering the price, TSF should be doing enhancement. More free themes, widget should be scrollable, interesting wallpaper and live wallpapers...  But in the early stage..  This app is great. Good work!!!
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Great!!!&&&The smoothest launcher i have ever use!!!Good job!!!! Looking forward to your update!!
 - June 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Significant improvement.&&&Like it.
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Fast and unique&&&
 - June 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Galaxy Note&&&Running buttery smooth on my note and a lot of cool stuff as well. But I miss the overlapping widget and the ability to change app icon in Nova. TSF with these features will be 5 stars!
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&nice&&&good work !
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&We need more widgets&&&It very nice and fast . I loved it

 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Huge improvement&&&Huge improvement with last update. Makes it feel like I spent the money on something worth the price. Great job guys
 - June 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Amazing! but explain added permissions please&&&Amazing launcher, super smoottthhhh!  Would like a little more info regarding the added permissions though.
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Love it!&&&Thanks for all the updates, it does everything I want now! You can't go wrong with this O/S.
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Wow!!&&&I am very impressed. Most badass home screen replacement app I've ever used, and it runs so smooth! That's the part that most impresses me. Love it far more than my stock ICS home screen.
 - July 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 4G &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&New shells&&&When are y'all gonna do new free shells. I have rated this 5 stars but hope that ya do new shell themes soon.
 - July 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Well...&&&So far so good. I like this product but not it's price lol
 - July 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&GS3 awesomeness!!!&&&Buttery smooth, if you have a larger screen phone, this launcher is by far the best way to go. It may take some time getting used to, but once you get your setup, you'll never go back to sense/touchwiz/adw/go/lp/ or whatever you're used to. I can't believe I'm saying this but I really am glad I played the cost. Can't wait for more updates. Don't disappoint!!!
 - July 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Best launcher yet!&&&Just about every "issue" that is posted here is either user error, or phone OS error. This launcher runs flawlessly and is worth every penny. I just hate that there are so many negative reviews due to lack of experience.
 - July 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Thief&&&After purchasing TSF Shell and using it for about 3 weeks it was great. Now I got a pop up telling me license not valid and to uninstall . Is this the $16.00 trial?
 - July 3, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Casio G'zOne Commando &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Keeps dumping my desktop&&&Seems to dump my desktop from Time to time. THE BACKUP NEVER WORKS. NOT ONCE. I'm never In a convenient place when this happens. I'm sick of losing all my folders on my 16 dollar launcher.
 - July 3, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Wiped my pages 4 times&&&Very slick but way to buggy! I paid £10 for this shell.. For a beta? I'm the stupid one really... Not the dev! Well I've paid for it now! Won't.. Can't use it daily but I will keep my eye on it. Hopefully the bugs will be sorted soon.
 - July 3, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Mmm&&&Not bad
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Galaxy tab 7.7&&&It's great but wedget music  and live wallpaper don't work.
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.03 Beta&&&Love it but....&&&I would love to be able to put a title at the top of each screen please make this possible
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&The best just got way Better!&&&Great launcher, works great on the Evo 4G! Do not bother with other launchers, I've tried them all. This is the one. With this update, it is the best on the market. Hoping for a fix on scrolling Widgets as they aren't working.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Great update!&&&Adding live wallpapers was something we have been asking for a while, i'm happy to see you have been listening :). I'm also pleased with the 3d gallery widget. It runs as smooth as a greased up deaf guy and looka great as its doing it. Cpu and ram usage has gone down a touch which i appreciate a lot as it saves my battery too. I'll keep the 5th star for the next update ;)
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One S &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Awesome! Just a few kinks.&&&So buttery smooth on the One S and no problems on memory or anything.. In love. Keep it up!
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Awesome&&&Claims to runs scrolable widget.. But scrollings are laggy and buggy.. Pls fix.. I really like using pure messenger and i like tsf.. But they need to compliment each other.. 4 star - galaxy note ICS
 - June 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Still so close&&&Many improvements made but still landscape mode is one or the other, no automatic transition. You REALLY need auto transition, fix that and I add a star. Still just a 3 star program at a 5 star price! Not really worth the 16+ bucks either, but then neither was spb 3d either and I have that, but it IS a better program!! God Bless!!!
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&WOW&&&And I don't mean World Of Warcraft. Beautiful form and function. This is how it should be done.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Best launcher for my&&&Mejor launcher para mi y fíjate que e probado la gran mayoría
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Unique and best...!&&&It's getting better and better in every update. Great developer also. Replies quickly.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Very Impressive!&&&Yesterday's update was like Christmas! Scrolling widgets live wallpaper and a support gallery widget. Count me as very, extremely impressed with this launcher. It is unbelievably smooth, rich in practical features with attractive eye candy. Unlike SPB Shell the wow factor doesn't wear off in five minutes. For an initial release this delivers on the core expectations. TSF Shell is really a paradigm shift. Brilliant!
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Much much better&&&The update took a long time, but there are some great additions, including live wallpaper and the new gallery widget is  very cool!  I love that you can have as many screens as you want.  Things that would make it perfect are being able to change all icons to custom icons like in go launcher, the map flag as seen in video and the music widget to work easier.....
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Needs Work - Still  Better Than Most&&&This is a very nice UI.First month in and we have an update! Bravo! I liked the lasso the original way, but if it helps someone use it properly, then so be it.The only thing this launcher offers is a novel way of moving files - do not stray too far from this original purpose! And not as many reloads. The dock is a welcomed addition. Bravo! Keep at it.
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Awesome&&&With the latest update, this has become the ultimate launcher by all sense in the android world. Suggest to make more themes and widgets available.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Super Smooth&&&Far exceeded my expectations. It is now my favorite. Need to be able to lock the screen to avoid accidentally moving icons and widgets. The ability to hide applications would be great. Looking forward to the next update. Love it!
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Needs a few updates, more apps allowed in a folder, fix music player widget, ...&&&Needs a few updates, more apps allowed in a folder,  fix music player widget, allow live wallpapers, and more personlized screens
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Great WIP quick on almost any device!&&&Absolutely live the latest update delivery on just about every thing we have been asking for.. just a thought though maybe blacking out the back ground on the app page ...I noticed no matter what lwp I use it gets pretty laggy swiping my apps
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC One S &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Bad&&&New update suck, most widgets don't load
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&I bought this day one&&&Haha, other launchers...
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Latest update makes a great launcher perfect!&&&Light on memory and very fast & smooth. Quick bar is great! Live wallpaper support, resizable widgets, 3d gallery widget, app sorting, icon editor - great stuff! Needs more themes by tsfui, the ones on the market are terrible for the most part.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Excellent&&&But portrait mode will not work for me as a wallpaper option. Anyone?
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Message Widget&&&I love TSF Shell and it's widgets and outstanding features, but I still haven't seen a message widget for TSF I would love to see how you would incorporate something like that into TSF. I look forward to seeing more widgets!!! Thank you
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Tsf shell&&&Never update this app. It wont open after. Save 16$.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Best launcher&&&Love everything about this. Well worth the price for something that you constantly look at. Wouldn't trade it for anything.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Great update!&&&Best launcher after all
 - June 22, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Great Update!&&&Excellent update!
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Version 1.5! AWESOME!!!&&&Fixed just about everything with added extra out of this world features!  Well worth the money! Keep up the fantastic work TSF!
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&amazing!&&&now, with livewallpaper support - it is simply the best.
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Nice!&&&Thanks for developer' s hardwork, very nice!
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Just perfect for my Note! !!! Just want sw some new widgets&&&
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Great update&&&
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.0.02 Beta&&&Slowly but surely...&&&Loved the last update! Going great so far!
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0 Beta&&&Blurry&&&It would seem that the resolution on the galaxy nexus is too good....icons are blurry to the point that its not usable due to being so annoying. Will rerate and install if this is fixed.... wish in would have gotten my refund in time. No response from devs either :( repeated unanswered emails from devs
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.5.0 Beta&&&Needs work, has potential&&&Soo happy i stuck with this app.. Every update it gets better and better. Great job on the job common dock bar(hot). Would like to see more characters and items for plug ins.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Cayman &&& 1.5.0 Beta&&&Getting  better  keep updating  thanks&&&Thanks  guys really  appreciate  the hard work  keep  it coming we want the SLIDING  MAP NOW !! PLEASEEEE !!!! I added one more star . Give us wat we want and well put 5 stars
 - June 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0 Beta&&&Live Wallpaper&&&Change the RENDER Mode in settings and Live Wallpapers will work.
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.5.0 Beta&&&Best launcher&&&Wonderful features and great ux. Give it a moment to get used to and you will love it.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.0 Beta&&&Overpriced and lacks basic features&&&Updating my review to 4 stars following a significant update! Many of the previous issues have been resolved including live wallpaper support and resizable widgets! Only thing left now is to allow the same transistions between homescreens as those available for the app drawer! Keep up the good development!
 - June 21, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.5.0 Beta&&&VERY DOPE! But still needs work.&&&Keeps crashing with a live wallpaper running after new update. Looks good but still has a few some bugs.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.0 Beta&&&Better than before ...&&&I'd like to see an option to make that quicklaunch bar sticky - always visible.
 - June 22, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.0 Beta&&&Flu&&&Too slow with thr updates. A beta version fot that price is ridiculous
 - May 7, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&so far its awesome !&&&Great launcher! Would like to see scrollable Widgets and resizeable Widgets. Also a picture slide show like the music widget where it pops up. Only other thing; would be a selection for home screen. Unless I just haven't figured out how to select that yet. 3 stars only cuz its still very new. Look forward to what comes next. Worth the money if you want a fresh and different Android experience.
 - June 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Still needs attention from the developer&&&Updated Review: it had a good start but now it turned into a total failure. No updates in a month and no improvements since the initial launch. Dev promised regular updates but never seen them. Looks like another "hit and run" business approach. They collected 17$ per idiot and they don't care anymore, like SPB, ClockworkMode and many others did.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Simply amazing&&&Just one thing. Would be nice to have live wallpaper. Originally had got the app for free but because i love it, i bought it to support the developers.
 - June 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Tsf shell in a nutshell&&&Good home shell but not for the price too expensive for what it does so far needs more widgets and use up as little battery as Possible this home shell would be the best in the play store and worth the money if when you turn on your phone it would also start the shell faster spending almost no time having it boot up also integrate more with Android OS as if both are just one system this shell may well become the standard for Android needs to update as much as go launcher does to become the best launcher.
May 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&You can't beat the customer service and updates&&&Terrible battery drain. :( uninstallung until next update. Battery life cut in half when I use it. Otherwise Its had some issues but its a great app and the updates keep rolling out so shows the customer appreciation is there.  Will continue to use and can't wait to see what future updates hold.
 - May 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Not bad&&&I'm really diggin it. But I'm getting pretty good battery drain with this launcher.  If I switch back to Nova my battery increases.  Lost another star unfortunately because with this launcher activated and while running simple apps.  My phone gets up to 110 degrees.  Tested all this with the Nova launcher and battery life increases as well as temps going way down.  Tested this on two of my friends phones as well with the same issues.  Looking forward to a fix
 - May 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Very smooth&&&Even smoother than the default launcher. Some missing features like hiding apps and resizing icons and Widgets. Even still its easily the best looking and most powerful launcher available. Keep working at it guys!
 - June 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&very awesome best&&&wow wow wow try it and fall in love super great just try it and be hooked   I need to say a little more about this app it is great very interactive and is worth the price   But it does lag from time to time and also drains battery I have to charge more often now  needs some updates and to support live wallpaper   other things I will not list here just get it and find out it is worth it and I hope for the price we paid that the developer stays on top of the improvements  lost one star do to lots of lag on last update
 - May 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Keeps getting better&&&This launcher just keeps getting better! Thanks for making the lasso and home screen scrolling options. I liked those things the way they were.
 - June 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Awesome!&&&Almost perfect!  And fun to play around with.  Lots to learn, which makes it even better.  Read the easy-to-follow manual cuz it'll answer most, if not all, of your questions... :)  I have not noticed abnormal battery drain, either (I thought it'd be huge due to all of the functionality of this launcher, but not with my Motorola Droid 4).  And it's updated SOOOOOOOOO MUCH MORE OFTEN than SPB Shell 3D!!!
 - May 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Arc S &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Getting worse.&&&I do not understand, first this launcher was the best I have ever seen and now I remembered about my previous one – Go Launcher and I understood that in some ways it is better than TSF if you want the public to keep loving your product than make something new something that would keep us love it, think of innovations or one by one you will lose people.
 - May 15, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Good but way too expensive&&&...also, I have to keep reinstalling as it keeps disappearing from my system
 - May 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Amazing launcher&&&Ill have to say, the dev for this little program is top notch. I think there has been 2-3 updates in the last few days to fix various bugs and stuff that people are reporting. This app will get a fifth star once auto rotate is added. Great work so far TSF Crew.
 - May 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&galaxy nexus&&&Scrolling widgets don't work well, if at all. Like with the stock calendar. Running AOKP milestone 5
 - May 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Its worth the money.&&&Its really worth if they update it with new Widgets.  Because other Widgets won't work fast as they used to. This is really better than other launchers but they need more serious updates.
 - May 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Outstanding&&&It constantly gets better and better. And I actually get responses to questions and recommendations. Best UI on android, can't wait for more to come along.
 - May 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Guys, give the dev's a break.&&&I'd love to be able to change the grid size on the home screen, from the default 6x5.  I'd like 8x6 or so. This launcher is improving more and more
 - June 10, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Update plz&&&I prefer the TSF shell than this soz but i am being honest u guys need more updates so plz update if u can cos we ve payed $20 for this thx
 - May 14, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&cool&&&still quite complicated, anyone know how they make the music player like that in the pic? just shows the music player not the big picture/icon above
 - May 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Good but still needs some work&&&Some good ideas and features but what always stops me from using it all the time is the lack of resizable widgets. Introduce that and I'm sure I wouldn't be using another launcher. Also couldn't use on cm9 when I had it on my device, it claimed it wasn't compatible with my device.
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Great&&&I have used a lot of the home screen replacements and I have found this one to be the best ever. I would like to see a few more add ons but I have found it worth the money. No crashes so far and I have been using it now a couple of weeks.
 - May 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Absolutely Fantastic&&&They fixed the compatibility issues with buying the app, based on request. The app is great with unmatched features anywhere else. It makes the phone feel like a new one. Highly recommend and well worth the money!
 - May 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&More and more than i guess!!!&&&First of all, i have been watching TSF for about 2 months and yesterday i decided to buy it... With one word "it worths 17 dollars!!!" :D Why? It offers you a new looking and a lots of customizations! There is a few little bugs, and i hope there will be "widget resizing" in the future.. Anyway 5 big stars!!!!
 - May 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Great launcher that will hopefully keep getting better&&&I was hesitant at first, cuz of the price & mixed reviews. But I overall really like this software & dev. Beautiful & unique. Updates have been good, and I hope they continue to improve this. Criticism: need resizable widgets, better memory management & overall more customabilty
 - June 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&The app is absolutely excellent&&&The app is perfect the way it is, but why stop there?? Please add social Widgets and make the music player widget better? It's much easier to choose from an Artists and Albums folder than the actual raw folders. And a calendar widget please?? Also a left hand mode for the screen preview please?? Thank you!
 - May 18, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Galaxy note&&&Lasso selection works even if it is not activated, in case of vertical gesture. Makes a lot of trouble. Also please add icoming calls/sms/mail marks to the icons
 - May 7, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Razr:&&&Cool UI, but not useful enough. It is lacking so many features that could make it amazing. It was too late to refund... Hopefully there's a nice update soon...
 - June 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Where are the updates?&&&18 bucks and still doesn't work right. Where are the updates for this launcher?
 - May 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Superb Effort!&&&This new GUI on my SGN sure the coolest ever! Smooth and fast loading interface that i already inform all my android fans out there to try this one out. If you can provide the email widget for this theme im sure this will be the perfect theme i have so far! Thanks!
 - May 13, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&FANTASIC CREATIVITY BUT EXPENSIVE&&&10 stars for creativity and effort. 2 stars for Eveything else mentioned in previous reviews. Its people like this we need to encourage. I will increase the rating when it gets more features and options.
 - May 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Really Bad on TF101&&&It comes up in compatibility mode and crashes constantly. Not sure why it even showed up for my tablet if it is this bad on it. Unfortunately,my connection went down while trying this on the road so I could not get a refund and am stuck with this now.
 - June 12, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Changing rating&&&, not worth the money. But it has potential. Add more customizations. Widgets, and reliable widgets. Widgets disappear. Constantly having to reload them.  It is way overpriced for what it is now. Spb shell is much better. Once this one is done it may be good.
 - May 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Great!&&&Everything keeps getting better and better with every update. However still needs scrolling widgets support, also would be nice to hide some of the apps in the drawer, and lastly there is a problem with the "direct dial contact schrtcut".. I placed the shortcut on the home screen, when I pressed it, it keep saying the application is not installed on my phone! The same shortcut works just fine on other launchers, just not on this one. DHD
 - June 18, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Android 1&&&What about the flag map the one that is on the video we have had 3 updates and still nothing. 16 bucks ;( how about some updates. Whats going on where are the updates. Dam go takes care of there users
 - May 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Htc evo&&&This is so cool better than any other. But please put widget for facebook and make able for live wallpaper. New updates are awesome
 - June 6, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Problems&&&I have purchased the program but the live wallpaper does not support and the map in the sidebar does not exist like the video shows
 - June 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Mike&&&sucks the live wallpaper doesnt work!!! Or the flagmap thing! Please fix n ill give 5 stars=) choosing your own home screen sounds good too!
 - May 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia S &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Great!&&&My daughter is an avid iPhone follower, she picked up my phone and said "you're phone is so cool, can I have it and you can have my new upgrade phone" says something don't you think :-D great job guys!
 - May 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Galaxy Nexus- Smoothest launcher out there!&&&Extremely smooth. With custom themes and widgets coming down the pipe this will probably be the best launcher out there! Yes even better then MIUI :)
 - June 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&ICS&&&We need more widgets like 3D Twitter , email, pictures etc. Please
 - June 1, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Not done&&&Just like others have said. Its definately not finished.  Once it has all features as shown in the demo ill give it 5 stars.
 - May 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Slow improvements&&&Using it more often since updates. I sti have at least 6 reloads per day and all random. Must be a memory management issue. Any advice to help this?  MOTOROLA ELECTRIFY.
 - May 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Jbohmzb&&&Works well on my galaxy s2 so far, no major battery drain or issues. Keep up the good work.
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&best launcher&&&only launcher that comes close is SPB shell 3d but this is still better
 - May 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Beats any OEM launcher!!!&&&Truly a first class launcher!! Smooth, reliable and visually appealing, the animations and scrolling run at a cozy 60 fps on my phone. It would be great if the dev. added screen transitions to the slide effect, maybe a 3d one similar to HTC Sense 4.0? If that was added I would leap for joy...
 - May 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Messy, Cool, Interesting, lack of widgets & tools&&&If able to make folder and arrange the apps on the pages that can view all the apps will be good, Less TSF widgets and tools, not like go launcher that have go msg, go theme, go locker, go task manager, go todo or more concept is pretty cool, hope can get more updates and changes for not wasting our money. AFTER UPDATE: oh yes i am satisfied with the sliding standard mode and other bug fixed, SUGGEST add on DOCK and some EFFECT on sliding.
 - May 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Worth every penny&&&I first bought this launcher the day it was released. Was pissadointed. But now, everything has improved. Looking forward to future updates.
 - June 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Great App&&&But it's been over a month since the last update - any news on when we'll see the next one?
 - June 2, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Do it batter&&&For the cost of this I expected better widget support, more customizable settings, and auto-rotate at least.
 - May 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Fantastic launcher&&&I must update my previous review. This app is continually updated frequently. Each version gets better and better. This is now my default launcher.
 - May 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Very impressed&&&Still the best IMO. Maybe resizeable widgets option and more launcher widgets. Like Facebook would be awesome. All in all my favorite launcher though.
 - May 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Allmost Perfect&&&Only two requests.  1.  Resizing widgets 2.  Scrollable widget support.
 - May 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Okie, now that the bug has been fixed&&&Pretty good launcher overall
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&So awesome!&&&It was buggy at first but little by little it keeps improving. Hope the music update allows you to save playlists. Keep it up folks!
 - June 18, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Hollywood&&&NEEDS MORE  OPTIONS! FOR THE PRICE THAT I PAID,I AM SO BORED WITH THIS LAUNCHER AND I CANNOT PUT ON MY GALAXY TABLET 8 9 THIS APP IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE ONLY WORTH $.99
 - May 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Love it!&&&This is one of my favorite apps. I love the animations I would not have an Android phone with this app.
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Straight to the point....Best Launcher out there!&&&I don't ever leave reviews but i felt for anyone thinking.... hmmm that's to much money should i buy it?  The answer is yes!  It really is a brilliant launcher, you won't be sorry.  Yes i have tried all the launchers out there and yes some free ones are really good but TSF Shell is the boss of them all. I give it 5 stars well done to the dev brilliant work. Galaxy Note
 - May 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Almost perfect.&&&4 Stars for not being compatible with live wallpapers.
 - May 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Please fix!&&&TSF Shell is a pretty good app, but there are 2 issues that make it pretty unusable for me. I have a Galaxy Nexus and a lot of apps. The first is that it takes an extremely long time to reload every time I come back to it from an app. I mean a full 30 seconds or more EVERY time. The 3rd party widgets take a long time too.  The second is that I can't resize the widgets and they are very slow in responding - esp. the scrolling ones. If these 2 problems were fixed, in my eyes this shell would be perfect! :-)
 - May 18, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Its a five if&&&Best buy I have ever made on market, I only want live wallpapers and the ability to create my own icon themes from the launcher no third party theme required like other launchers can do then it will be a five for me. Very pleased so far though.
 - May 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&???&&&???????????????
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Pleased&&&I've tried a number of launcher and home screen apps but they all seemed to be missing something. So far I'm very pleased with TSF and consider it worth the cost considering how fast and smooth it is, the customization and ease-of-use offered by many of the features and the low RAM usage paired with almost unnoticeable effect on battery life.   I recommend this app to anyone looking for a good, frequently updated home screen alternative. I'll be looking forward to the new features to come.
 - June 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&New on website&&&Looking forward to the coming soon release!
 - May 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Live wallapaper, live wallpaper...&&&Can we have the live wallpaper enabled now pretty please??? ...lol
 - May 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Awesome&&&This is a great and I love the animated Widgets tho there are only 3 of them. I would love to see more cool animated Widgets. A Facebook widget with some cool animations would be awesome. Only thing I would say bad about this launcher is the reloading when you hit the home button but I think they just fixed that for the most part. The launcher is really smooth and and very user friendly.
 - May 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Best UI launcher&&&I love this launcher cos its got the best interface. However my Galaxy Note is overheating a lot and suffers from extreme battery drain because of it - that's a severe letdown on something that is near perfection. On the plus side this is the fastest launcher I've used. Love the Post It notes.
 - June 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Amazing&&&This is awesome on my samsung galaxy s3,no probs with anything so far! Battery life is great with it too! Cant wait to get more updates with new stuff to it
 - June 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Great launcher&&&The only thing missing is the live wallpaper support, then it would be five stars
 - May 14, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Almost perfect&&&This is the smoothest launcher I've ever used apart from FTL, but the lack of widget capabilities are troublesome. Scrollable Widgets to be precise. For the price, this should have been included from the start. Waiting for an update...
 - May 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Good. Different!!!&&&At least something different than the original OS! Thanks and keep working! Can't put live wallpaper on tsf shell or any other wallpaper that is not tsf
 - May 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Monstrous potential!!!&&&I didn't like this Launcher when I first got it, but I found it fun learning its features, though the learning curve for me seemed steep, probably just me. Really smooth, though I think that the sensitivity of the screen is almost to responsive. I find the ability of placing the Icons seemingly anywhere on the screen both annoying  and really cool too!  It works great with cm modded devices like mine, I don't see way it wouldn't work as good or better on stock Carrier Garbage interfaces  I gave it a 4 because it is so different to operate and set up, and the Help section needs work. And also for what Cody said, along with Live Wall paper. If these things were fixed it would be worth the cost which I think is a little steep.  But over all, I am still using it after a week, and I really don't morn the cost. Great job!
 - May 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&It's ok and could get even better&&&I like the concept but you need more widgets and more options like the ability to change fonts and the ability to change the color of the glow without changing the theme entirely... You should look at all the options given in go launcher to get some ideas.. ill give u five stars cause this is a good start..
 - June 13, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Mark&&&Not working too good on galaxy s 3. Keeps reloading when leaving apps
 - May 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Needs auto landscape&&&I like the UI but I put it on a tablet that's 7 inch and I flip between land scape and upright a lot. Hope you guys fix this I would give 5 stars
 - June 18, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Smooth but needs LOTS of work.&&&It's unique. It's smooth. But... Scrollable widgets don't work. Can't resize widgets. Scrollable widgets don't work. where is version 1.5 that shown over a week ago?
 - May 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&So futuristic, just needs to support live wallpapers...&&&Will 5star it when it supports live wallpapers!
 - May 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Great&&&Needs icon and widget resizing tool. I know you can resize the icons but they need to be bigger. Thanks
 - May 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&User 1&&&More widgets plz, and resize/scrolling widget support
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Changed review.&&&With this new update, the launcher is now worth the price. Thank you so much devs.
 - May 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Wallpaper&&&The wallpaper is not full screen on motorola atrix
 - May 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&we are getting there... one more star added.&&&Only 3 stars (upped from 2 since last review) for now until the implement all the listed features in the video + some functionalities from other launchers,  like swiping gesture and other options.
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Brilliant&&&TSF Shell is a Brilliant App. It is my launcher of choice. Thanks also to all the developers, for providing the assortment of themes, that simply make for a perfect environment.
 - May 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Amazingg&&&Best launcher I have used!! (i have used many)
 - May 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Good one&&&Very like this themes... ^^ more update more creativity u can get in tsf..

 - May 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Good&&&Love it. Can you make an option to get rid of notification bar on the home screen. All the other shells have that option.
 - May 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Finally perfect again.&&&Best launcher right now.

 - May 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Seneca&&&Sweet, but no 5 stars!!! No livewallpaper!!! And it needs more Widgets, like Facebook and twitter!

 - May 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Great&&&This is the best launcher. I have tried many including spb and this is by far the best and the themes are awesome to
 - May 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&brilliant&&&Now the Android Robot ready to eat it hhhhhmmmmmmmmm ;-)
 - May 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&Force close&&&Just a black screen now then force close on my EVO 3d, bit odd considering its a dual core phone, I paid all that money for a black screen lol
 - May 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&So far...&&&I'd like to see more customization, maybe and app drawer icon so I can go straight to it. Also a way to change where it (drawer) is...
 - May 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.2.03 Beta&&&My review...boooo&&&I saw the video and was excited about something that looked so good, but honestly launcher pro let's you do do much more than this...simple things like swiping screens resizing widgets changing icons editing widgets on the fly....all those convenient things I sacrificed for something"new"that has honestly been a let down.yea the weather widget and folder opening is cool. But that's basically what you will pay 17 $ for....getting Better...but not good enough yet
 - May 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Almost there..&&&Now just need 4g enabler on the settings area and it'll be perfect for me.   Also. My apps keep disappearing and I'd need to restart tsf. ALMOST there.  Also needs social widgets like twitter or fb. That will definitely give this a win over GO launcher because that's the only thing left it can't do. g
 - May 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Updates are restoring my faith in these devs&&&This is the fifth time i changed my review. They have acomplished everything I wanted out of this shell. Great job devs and you have earned 5 star.
 - May 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Nice but still needs work&&&I like this launcher, but it still needs some work. After opening a program, my wallpaper disappears and I have to restart the launcher. It also needs to be able to rotate to landscape or portrait mode when the phone is turned. The music widget needs some work. Currently it defaults to play every song on my phone. Overall this is one of the best launchers in the market today when it comes to looks and uniqueness, but there are a lot of things that need work.
 - May 4, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Samsung Epic&&&Icons unresponsive to touch at times, widgets and folders randomly disappear, constantly resetting, shell loading takes too long on start up, I am being to feel stupid for buying this. I want to like it. Please make it right!
 - May 5, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Stratosphere &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Live wallpaper?&&&5 stars when live wallpaper working 100% and the updates keep making it run worse........
 - May 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Half and half&&&At first I thought this was an awesome launcher, but after awhile some of the application icons didn't pop up, which drove me nuts lol and you can't do a whole lot with widgets either. I would like to see maybe some more customization options seeing as this cost me a bit more than other launchers. Overall appearance was excellent, just update it and make it even better. Go launcher is my first choice.
 - May 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - ZTE X500 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Klocndgr&&&Great shell does most of what it says nice eye candy ...on that note running on ZTE X500 and cannot use live wallpaper not a biggy just says its supported..another minor flaw the speed scrolling mode doesnt work as said doesnt matter how fast i flick between screens still ends up one screen over...overall those minor problems arent very important more excited about what will be added next keep up the great work...best $17.00 investment for this phone thats for sure
 - May 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Nice launcher&&&It is a good launcher. Has some very unique features and i am eager to see what the devs come up with in the future.
 - May 4, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Tsf shell&&&What the heck none of my icons are working since the update! HTC evo 4g
 - May 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Worth 17$? ...&&&Extremely smooth. Updates are very good so far. Getting closer to five stars. ...keep up the good work.
 - May 4, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Last update doesn't work&&&The last update I did it doesn't work, I really hope they fixit soon enaugh... The program get frixing all the time....
 - May 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Update problem...&&&I just update and I cannot run apps on the desktop. Check it.
 - May 4, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Must downgrade until fixed&&&I just updated as well and launcher is now useless to me on my DINC2... Can't access any apps, must go back to HTC sense and SPB shell for time being until fixed. Apps do launch after repeated tapping... Also not launching from app drawer. I tried rebooting, clearing app cache and force stopping to no avail. Had to go back to my old standby SPB Shell 3D for the time being.
 - May 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Great App!!&&&
 - May 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Getting better&&&I like the updates  better to the 360 selecting mode.waiting to use live wallpaper and waving flag
 - April 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.2&&&Better since update...&&&Update fixed a serious issue with disappearing widgets. That's good. Still need to be able to resize widgets and need auto rotation between portrait and landscape. Homescreen settings don't stick when switching between portrait and landscape. Lasso function button should be put in quick pick drawer. I hate having it obscure my clock widget.
 - May 4, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&SGS II crash&&&After latest update it freezes from time to time. Icon apps don't respond except in apps page. Love the app.. pls fix. :(
 - May 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2.02 Beta&&&Amazing Performance!!&&&
 - May 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2&&&Great, but needs a few things to be awesome&&&I love this launcher. I know it's still in the early stages so I can definitely deal with it, but this launcher NEEDS these things: resizable widgets, ability to hide apps, no text under icons option, gestures, and when I create a path out of a folder and choose an app, the folder needs to close so when I hit home I don't have to close the folder path.
 - May 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.4.2&&&WOW!&&&I am amazed. TSF Shell is incredible! I have just spent the best $17.80 (+ Piano theme). I LOVE this!  MILESTONE X2
 - April 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.4.2&&&You have got to be kidding me...&&&First update in a couple of months and you didn't even add auto rotate.... or make it ics compatible. How in the world do you justify the amount of money you charge with such poor deving... give your costumers what they want.
 - April 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2&&&Yep,it's a BLAST!&&&I only sleep aFEW hrs every couple days Im *SO*in*LOVE*w/my phone,*ALWAYS*on it. Welp,Im screwed *NO*sleep 4me *ANYmore*cuz this IS a BLAST,THANK YOU!
 - May 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2&&&Really though&&&This is a beautiful home replacement but to charge $15 for the app and then $2 for each additional theme. I mean, c'mon!
 - April 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2&&&Smooth&&&Gets better with each update, making slide screen transition was a much needed!!  Still trying to get live wallpaper to work, it worked once for me, thank u for adding Android shortcuts,  that was a very missed feature when I changed home launchers
 - May 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.4.2&&&Not so great...&&&I would like to correct my previous review (which was written after 4 days of using this shell). I'm now after several weeks with it, suffering from many crashes and glitches, and today the shell just crashed taking with it ALL my folders which took me very long time to organize!!! Making just a nice UI is not enough! you have to take care of bugs and problem, especially with an application that costs so much! One big disappointment
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.2&&&#2&&&Why #2 because #1 is spb shell but I always go back to tsf.
 - June 25, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.4.2&&&Fails to deliver on basic features&&&We have to wait at least a month between most updates, still lacking on certain customization options that other launchers have been providing for over a year. No auto landscape/portrait mode. Constant force closes on both my stock Incredible 2 and my rooted Kindle Fire. After paying 16 dollars you guys need to focus on stability and functionality before adding more widgets etc. Please update more frequently.
 - April 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.4.2&&&Lasso button&&&Please place the button and include it within the side column bar. The button is only used rarely and its not nice to have it at the top corner.
 - May 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.4.2&&&Progress...&&&This is fantastic. It's extremely smooth. Yes, it's a little tricky to get to grips with, but reasonably intuitive, and far less glitchy than SPB on my phone (HTC Desire). SPB was often FCing on return to home screen this to anyone with experience of SPB and similar launchers. Also, on the plus side, the dev said the app would be released on Feb 29, and it has been. There's been many other launchers that did/have not made it to market when promised. Updates are just making it even more staggering...
 - June 19, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.4.2&&&They are liers&&&Seriously update is way past due..........wow still no updates dont download not worth it at all go launcher does way way more and it is free
 - May 2, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2&&&fBack option&&&Need more than one backup.  The program errored and reconfigured wipe out my back up.  Lost all the time I spent getting things right then have all deleted.  Why have a backup if it is wipe out when the program errors.  The purpose of a backup is to protect against this.    05/02/2012 update:  Did it again.  TSF errored and caused the GNex to reboot.  It did a restore to TSF and then a backup that wiped out my backup.  Now I have blank desktops (except for the app "drawer") and no way to restore.    For those that use this shell I recommend that you make a copy of your backup.  That is you may want to backup your backup.
 - May 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.4.2&&&Great Launcher but&&&The update brought us scrolling screens. I would like to be able to turn the option off. I like the way it was before. All the other launchers use scrolling screens. Now we are not set apart as muchas before.
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.4.2&&&Getting there&&&NEW updates are good. Lasso button annoying would like hide option and where is the map tab. Still my favorite launcher Worth the $. Samsung inspire 4g
 - May 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2&&&Much better since update!&&&Keep them coming please. Still having some restarts when exiting some apps and would like to have an option for an application icon to quickly enter the app drawer.
 - April 30, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2&&&We're getting there...&&&I think this launcher could be great, but this is a very basic version of the preview videos that have been floating around for months.  To pay $17 for a half-baked app is crazy.  I hope they add more content... QUICKLY!  Update 04/30/12:  1.4.2 update is GREAT!  I like the fact that I can flip through screens now.  Also fixes the missing widget prob.  This launcher is by far the smoothest and quickest launcher that I have, and I have them all! I really want to see the eye-candy that was shown on the YouTube video, especially the "active flag" map.  But nonetheless this is a awesome update.
 - May 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2&&&Latest update&&&When the random and seemingly pointless force close problems are fixed this will be better. Still needs live wallpaper, and scrolling/resizable widgets to be a real home launcher replacement.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2&&&HTC EVO 4G&&&Excellent nothing else can be said
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4.2&&&Latest update bumped to 5 stars&&&New slide between screens update makes this best shell on market.
 - May 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.4.2&&&Please add map&&&Getting better. Please add the map :)
 - May 2, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2&&&good but not worth it&&&this is an good app with lots of creative but does not worth the price of $16AUD, its only worth around $5
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2&&&Nice&&&This last update was a really good one using lasso as an option instead of default am more please to  use the app now
 - May 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2&&&Good&&&Its really smooth on my galaxy nexus...but I cannot run any live wallpapers...I select them but they don't apply. Though normal wallpapers apply.
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2&&&Excellent Update.&&&I wait for more themes and support for live wallpapers.
 - June 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2&&&Improving&&&Where are the scrolling maps?
 - May 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.2&&&Not worth it&&&I want a refund. Not with the $16 I paid.
 - May 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 1.4.2&&&Unparalleled&&&amazing features, simple use, super fast. It just needs live wallpaper support and it'll be a five star app
 - May 3, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4.2&&&New lasso location&&&Needs to be in the launch bar.  It obscures widgets and home screen clock.  Hate that change, please fix!  Running MUCH faster with latest update.
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.4.2&&&GOD!&&&Nuff' said.
 - April 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2&&&Love it&&&5 star when it supports live wallpapers.
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 1.4.2&&&Skyrocket&&&Nice update
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2&&&Much improved&&&I changed my rating because they finally updated with a lot of the missing features. Love it.
 - April 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4.2&&&Good&&&
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 1.4.2&&&Continuous improvement.&&&Its getting better and better!
 - April 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2&&&Good&&&Wish it allows uninstall at other window levels.
 - May 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.4.2&&&Awesome&&&Best launcher ever. Even better than spb shell 3d
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.2&&&perfectly perfect&&&There is not a single launcher that come close to the functionality, customization, and intuitively as this launcher. ive tried all the launchers, this is the launcher that is the firstest with the mostest.... 10 stars in my book
 - April 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.2&&&Don't like&&&Unfortunately i found hilauncher is more organised and its free. I will wait until this launcher convinced me then I may use it again. The dock is an important feature in any luncher and the widest in this launcher is not flixaple as the icons so it is difficult to set both in on page as they're going to overlay on each other.
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2&&&HTC amaze&&&Awsome update!
 - April 22, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.4.01&&&Pls Update!&&&Great launcher! Only complaint is having to reload widgets after reboot & to be able to use live wallpaper.
 - April 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&Awsome&&&With every update it just gets better and better, I combine tags with widget pro and can finally say goodbye to go launcher and spn shell for good.looking forward to new updates with even more functionality
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.01&&&Galaxy note.. Amazingly Smooth...&&&First launcher which forced me to pay... Superbly smooth.... Butter like smooth graphics cool transitions.. And definately the best launcher out there in the AM. JUST 1 improvement needed.. That switching between home screens becomes possible with 3d effect..just by swiping fingers on any screen. pls add support for Live wallpapers
 - April 26, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&Crashes 3X a day&&&It's a great program, but takes 30 seconds or so to load every time it crashes (usually for no apparent reason). Deletes 2 panels every time, so I have to redo them if I want anything on them. Devs have ignored emails.  Has potential, but feels strongly like a beta right now.  3 stars when I can go for half a day without it randomly crashing, 4 when goes full day.
 - April 12, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Great but buggy as hell.&&&It looks great, smooth and full of eye candy. Would love to move the side bar from the left to the right and just wish it wouldn't keep restarting on me all the time. A launcher should open up quickly without having to wait for it to restart.. Not happy as I paid an arm and a leg for this application.
 - April 5, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&ANNOYING!&&&the launcher was doing good but after the new update it started getting more glitchy like repeated apps and Widgets disappearing and the launcher always reloads after I get a text message... I like the launcher a lot but u gata fix all these annoying bugs 5 stars when fixed
 - May 14, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Dissapointed&&&Still not like the video!  Had this for well over a month, No live wallpapers as yet etc etc  Wished I'd not wasted my money!  I've now installed Apex Launcher and to he honest it beats this hands down!!! Using the free version up to now but will be paying the Dev's of Apex the £2 odd they want for theirs.
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2&&&Great update&&&This implementation actually makes the ui a lot more intuitive.
 - April 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Super fast and fluid!&&&This launcher just keeps getting better and better with each release! I've also found some really nice themes on the market...the PCB ones are my favourite!
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.2&&&perfect&&&exelent update 5start
 - April 21, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&we got ripped off!&&&This should be the FREE DEMO version! There has been no serious update for how long?! Lacking functionality compared to the hyping video. Looking forward to update based on user feedback, but losing hope. -S2 T989
 - April 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.4.01&&&Bionic&&&Love it! Little quirks here and there but what doesn't? Regular updates keep things running smooth. Great job devs!
 - April 26, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.01&&&Constant restarting edit:&&&I love the app, but I can't keep it running long enough to enjoy it.  Problem solved somehow. I think it was magic. I'm happy.  Edit.  Still a problem. Not only does it restart and force close, it doesn't reload my widgets after sometimes.   Please fix.   Evo 3d.
 - April 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&Says it will work on my phone but it wont.&&&Sent 3 emails with no response. They will not refund my purchase!!!
 - April 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy W &&& 1.4.01&&&Best i have ever tested!!!&&&This is the best one i have ever installed in my galaxy wonder. No lagging, no force close...& amazingly smooooth....The only one launcher that allows rotation of icons.....even we can put icons over the widgets!!!
 - April 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4.01&&&Sweet & Sour&&&This is both. Still temperamental on Sumsung Indulge. Also any developer who charges what most market users wld. consider hefty --should provide excellent free themes--just my opinion.  The app is developing in a positive direction & I appreciate the hard work thus far.
 - April 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&Like it&&&At first I thought this would not be able to compete with SPB Shell ,   but  Thats not the case  , it has a completely different interface and I love it , very smooth and looks fantastic , there are a few little bugs  but I'm sure these will soon be ironed out in future updates  , if you want a launcher that stands out from the crowd .....this is it .
 - April 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Samsung Galaxy s2&&&Overall the launcher is great. Looks good. Very stylish. It definitely brings something new to the table. But I wouldn't give it 5 stars just yet. When I clear memory using task manager, it either restarts tsf shell or switches the homescreen back to any previous one. We could really use a fix for that issue. It gets really frustrating when I want to clear ram and end up switching homescreens at the same time.
 - April 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 1.4.01&&&Great launcher&&&I love the animations and transitions. An easier method of sorting apps to different screens would make it perfect. Also, making it compatibleb with tablets wood be awesome.
April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.01&&&Great app!!!&&&Great app, just a shame that you cannot group similar application's together in folders for faster access. All in all though a superb app
 - April 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!&&&The idea and interface are amazing but the shell crashes constantly and takes up to a minute to come back. Plus, last night it crashed so badly it erased all my settings and cleared all my pages. Waste of money until this gets fixed.
 - April 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&Pretty Decent&&&I like all the functionality that comes with this app.  You get a lot more freedom with customization than most others out there.  Its a little bit pricey in my mind for what you get.  And there are still a fair number of tweaks to work out.  A number of widgets don't work well with it, because of how the draw feature works for the shell.  But most can be handled.  I'd like to see more built in widgets with this app that handle that issue.   The biggest drawback of this app is that its a huge memory sink and takes a fair amount of time to load up.  But once its up and running it operates pretty smooth, you just don't have a lot of battery life.
 - April 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&It's different&&&It's not bad after you get used to it (takes a while to master the screen swipe - you use a big button on the bottom corner of the screen). That big button and the one to open the dock sometimes get in the way of the widgets and it doesn't support scrollable widgets or live wallpapers.
 - April 23, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&Promising but...&&&Nice concept, but useless due to permanent fc. Implementation of swiping to switch screens would be useful. For now I'm back to ADW Pro. Hopefully devs are working on the issues, it is costly enough to assume that.
 - April 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.01&&&Not yet it needs more fine tuning&&&It is nice but lacking some features. For example auto aspect detection. either you choose landscape or portrait. I can't get tsf to recognize any live wallpaper, it just stays on the current wallpaper. Also the ability to customize the crop size of a static wallpaper is limited. For the price you pay these features should be standerd. Now tsf does offer a unique experience among the other launchers. I think the closest launcher to tsf would be the spb launcher. Both are similar in price. I give tsf 3 stars
 - June 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 1.4.01&&&Update&&&Whats with the such long time with no update. cant be giving up on us now seriously
 - April 7, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.01&&&Very unsatisfied&&&Visually, it looks cool, but I'm continuously inadvertently changing my home screen while my phones in my pocket. Little things like that shouldn't be an issue with a $16 app! And there's barely ANY customization. Take a look at other launchers and take some pointers
 - April 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.4.01&&&Good&&&Not great. It restarts every once in awhile
 - April 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&demasiado grande en mi pantalla&&&desde la version 1.3 se ve muy grande en mi pantalla aunque baje la density porfavor arreglar esto yaaaa galaxy fit gt-s5670l
 - April 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Wierd&&&You know its odd... I paid 15$ for this launcher and nothing for Apex Launcher and Apex is supported like I paid 15$ and this is supported like it should be free. Hmpf.
 - April 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&Getting there.....&&&I really like this, but since the last update, I spend way too much time waiting for TSF to reload. Also I really need to be able add 'shortcuts' to the screens, not just widgets, I have AudioManager profile shortcuts, I'd very much like to use.  Going back to Go Launcher for now, and hopefully this reloading problem will be fixed, and the ability to add shortcuts will be added soon.
 - May 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&READ THIS WARNING .......&&&TSF, I know you just gave us a super update but pretty please let us resize the widgets. Not being able to resize widgets makes 50% or more of Android widgets unusable with this launcher. People considering purchasing this home replacement might want to wait for another update (or two) if you are accustom to using widgets the way they were intended. Other than that its a great home replacement. Definitely one to keep an eye on. Easily 5 stars once we can resize and scroll standard Android widgets...
 - April 20, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Galaxy nexus cm9&&&Says was updated for density settings,but fc"s constantly when long press making it unusable.
 - April 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Needs a smaller foot print&&&Eats a lot of memory when running. Which causes it to reload a lot. Also the lasso needs to be a toggle.
 - April 13, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.4.01&&&Problems w wallpaper&&&After several attempts to not have my wallpaper cut off I cant figure it out.
 - April 10, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Fast but unpolished&&&Fast and has a unique UI that takes some getting used to. Feels unfinished because of missing options that are standard in other launchers.
 - April 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.01&&&Nearly perfect...&&&This breathed new life into my launch day EVO4G with CM7.2. I love it. It's fluid, smooth and showy. We can finally choose a different home panel, and the search button is now functional :) I just wish it had scrollable widgets...
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Changing rating due to updates.. widgets still unusable... Buggy still...&&&
 - April 11, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4.01&&&Unstable&&&I was having frequent lock ups when the screen was off - phone became totally unresponsive. Switched back to Trebuchet and the problem went away. Looks like this has gotten less stable as it wasn't happening a couple of versions ago...
 - April 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Needs improvements&&&The launcher is great, smooth and a real eye candy, but there are many things you can improve, I moved to TSF shell from go launcher, and comparing to the go, TSF has many to develop... Make it more optional! I want a launcher that allows me to do anything I want!
 - April 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.01&&&Beautiful&&&So many improvements since the first time I tried it! If I had one request it would be to allow customizing the number of screens to the absolute minimum.
 - April 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.4.01&&&Photon 4g&&&Hard reset and now this launcher which i purchased on launch day Is incompatible now? With rooted photon 4g.  Locked.
 - April 9, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.4.01&&&Simply Amazing!!&&&I'm sorry but I need my ability to slide between screens, I'm so used to it.  Expecting me to just forget that now is unrealistic.  I get that u were aiming for innovation but there's really no need to go re inventing the wheel here guys. Also it consistently crashes and the screen goes black. Except for that... Amazing job!
 - April 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 1.4.01&&&Droid3&&&Updates are great. needs include ability to turn off lasso tool and switch screens instead by swyping. Also desperately needs scrollable widgets. Icons including folders keep disappearing after updates and reloads
 - April 29, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Bad&&&I paid an got this like 5 months ago and I used it for half a day until I realised how messy and buggy it was and never used it again lol, I also have spb shell which I never use as ICS stock is so much better looking than this garbage.I regret ever buying this junk, do yourself a favor just get a simple launcher like apex, nova or adw which is a 3rd of the price and looks an feels better.
 - April 17, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.4.01&&&Good but glitches everywhere&&&My screen doesn't display tabs on my lower left button. Also I would love the ability to modify my icons.
 - June 4, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Oh boy, it says on their website that "Version 1.5.0 Beta(Coming soon) !" And ...&&&Oh boy, it says on their website that "Version 1.5.0 Beta(Coming soon) !"  And they promise to fix everything again .....
 - April 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.4.01&&&Tsf shell is good&&&I like the launcher only problem is lack of custom widget and expensive themes that should be free...  I mean you pay so much for the laucher then themes 2 y?  This app is totally expensive go launcher is free... Free!!!  I don't mind paying for the app its just the continuing price,  and i wish the developer would push more awesome widget and add ons
 - April 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia S &&& 1.4.01&&&Cool but not perfect&&&Crashes often. Unable to add TrackID widget. It always show no space on this home screen when the whole page is blank..please fix.
 - April 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Beautiful!!&&&Its my default launcher after trying Nova, ADW, LauncherPro and SPB shell. This tops them all.
 - April 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.01&&&NEED LIVE WALLPAPER SUPPORT!!&&&Nice Update! However we need Live Wallpaper Support!!
 - April 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4.01&&&Not as advertized&&&This is not, as it claims, a new "operational system" for your Android.  It's not even a GUI.  It's a home screen replacement app.  It's pretty.  It's not very customizable. It's expensive for a home screen replacement app.  I've gone back to SweeterHome.
 - April 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.01&&&Very Promising. UPDATED&&&*No auto-rotate of homescreen, but manual rotation is possible via settings. This rather unique home replacement takes a bit of getting used to, but is very slick and fast.
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.4.01&&&Great launcher/shell&&&It's different, it is very simple to use once you figure it out. It is heavier on the processor than zeam or other launchers but on a dual-core phone it's No problem. No problems with it on Droid Bionic.
 - April 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Cayman &&& 1.4.01&&&*Update* amazing&&&*Update 4/6/12* *added updates are wonderful TSF continues to deliver. Density settings are great addition and a manual for those who cant figure it out and stop reviewing badly*learn it* Best launcher I've used. And I've used numerous launchers. Worth every penny and even at launch it's smooth and clean. It will only continue to improve and new stuff added! ;) Get it!
 - April 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Getting alot better&&&Please allow us to hide the app page, and allow us to remove the names under the apps. Sorry but I prefer Go Launcher atm, until this improves further.
 - April 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Getting better&&&You guys just keep releasing those updates and I'll keep adding stars
 - April 7, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Needs improvement&&&An unpolished gem right here. Im sure as time goes by and the bugs get fixed it will be amazing.
 - April 17, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.4.01&&&Horrible *update*&&&Whenever I restart this launcher, it deletes ALL of my widgets.
 - April 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Wow.&&&This launcher is just amazing, worth every penny. Makes my phone smoother, looks super original, super customizable. Just awesome. A tablet version might be the best thing ever. And the map thing that is on the video might be good to. Good work!
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.01&&&Thoroughly Enjoying This Launcher&&&Can't wait for more themes, more widgets, and better integration of widgets like music interacting with Google Music or other 3rd party players
 - April 12, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Not worth $16&&&Needs more Widgets in 3d and 3d effects
 - April 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Do Not Buy!&&&On two separate occasions, it has erased my entire set of homescreens for no reason.  There are also several other problems I have run into.  I have emailed the developers on a couple of occasions and have yet to hear back anything.  Extremely frustrating for such an expensive app.  Buyer beware!!  Gnex.
 - June 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.01&&&Almost daily driver&&&Has come a very long way. Still needs auto rotate.
 - April 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.01&&&Love it.&&&Best Ui experience. Just wish it would run better on the background. It has to restart if I lock my screen while an app is open.
 - April 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Great&&&I saw hard working form your team,wish it become the best launcher for android
 - April 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.4.01&&&More customization please!&&&Super smooth, awesome ui. Needs to be able to move tool bar and screens button. Mix parts of different themes, like Go or ADW. Where is the flag tabs?
 - April 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.01&&&Very pleased&&&This latest update has made a big difference!  It's working great on my Galaxy Note! Keep up the good work!
 - April 4, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Dissapointing for the price&&&At this price for the launcher, I was expecting more free themes to play with. And more features... Oh well. Looks like I'll make my own theme for this launcher.
 - April 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Great&&&Love this..most creative launcher I have used..but needs support for scrolling widgets..i.e. Plume..Google plus.photo gallery widgets.and allot of other apps..
 - April 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4.01&&&AND THE CHAMPION IS...&&&It would be nice to see the words highlighted or enlarged upon selection while using the lasso option. Very nice launcher.
 - April 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4.01&&&Sweet&&&Really fast, very cool, and actually seems like it might use less battery than razr default launcher :D
 - April 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Now i love you TSF!!!&&&Thank you very much for the latest update! My SGS2 is now so smooth like a butter! Improvements as well are really cool! Like for example the back up for desktop config! Thank you again!
 - April 5, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Cant use anymore&&&Since last update keeps crashing after every action even going into this apps menu
 - April 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.4.01&&&Okay&&&Latest update is a definite improvement.  For the price I expect more, especially more widgets or at least all the widgets they show in the video.  Seems like the video should be replaced with one that is more like the product you're buying.  Isn't this false advertising?
 - April 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.01&&&Worked until 1.3.2&&&Works on Galaxy Nexus again after 1.4.0! Awesome work guys!
 - April 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.01&&&Thumps UP&&&A wanderful & fantastic app I hope the best for it
 - April 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4.01&&&Love it!&&&Super love this launcher!  Please create more themes :D Also please add the ability to use live wallpaper :)
 - April 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.01&&&Watch intro video before commenting!&&&This is the best launcher ever made. I would urge people to watch the 1.4.0 intro video before commenting. There are many comments about things that need improving that are already there. Keep the updates coming devs this is amazing work.
 - April 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.4.01&&&HTC Thunderbolt&&&Best home replacement out there by far.
 - April 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.4.01&&&Good&&&I hope live wallpaper work soon and i wish i could change the coulor of the home screen when u scrol betwen homes which is blue to other coulors.tnx.great app
 - April 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.4.01&&&Great start&&&This has most of what is shown in the video and it all works great. I would really like some extra editing features for the money and I'm really excited for an update that includes all the features shown.  I like that it is completely different from all the others.
 - April 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.4.01&&&Good app&&&Missing some key features of other launchers like everyone else said, but it's smooth, unique, and gets much better with each update.
