 - March 1, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 4.5&&&A Permissions Nightmare!&&&For a keyboard there is no way this app needs access to that many permissions. Just another offender in the ongoing practice of needlessly violating user privacy. Take a hard look at all the required permissions, research what each one means and what they are normally used for. You'll most likely come away from that pretty suspect or just ignorant. In theory a keyboard should need zero permissions. Uninstalling. Galaxy Tab 10.1 Honeycomb 3.2
 - March 14, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Lots of small issues&&&In general nice features, but I expect a keyboard to allow me to type anything. Pretty nice when it can guess what you want. But you need to really fight with this one, if you want to type exceptions, like use lowercase after a dot or correct a word starting from the middle. Not to mention, inserting a smiley in chat is 4 keypresses... Built in keyboard is just better.
 - December 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Love it&&&This is a awesome keyboard and i've wanted this kind since i saw the samsung galaxy phones of last year with swype built in. No reason not to get this while it is only a dime.
 - December 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Great app&&&Makes typing so much faster, I love it and definitely think it was worth the price. And fit anyone that's curious it works perfectly on android 4.0
 - November 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 4.5&&&Fantastic keyboard that keeps getting better!&&&Wish long presses were handled like the default gingerbread keyboard, it requires much less thumb movement to type alternate characters.
 - January 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&awesome!&&&this is a great app. very accurate. and and is good at saving you even when you miss the letters a bit. very customizable, and consist. I replaced go keyboard with this app.
 - December 12, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 4.5&&&Sweet!&&&Nice keyboard, much better than the pre-installed swype that comes stock for a lot of us takes some getting used to but once you get it down its great
 - January 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Super app! Must-buy&&&I bought the DROID 3 specifically for the physical keyboard, but I still have to use the touch keyboard every once in a while. I saw this when it went on sale, and decided to give it a quick try. I was thoroughly impressed, and I'm suggesting this keyboard to anyone who owns an Android phone.  Please take my advice and get this app, it's definitely worth the money.
 - January 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Nice!&&&Very satisfactory alternative to swype. Especially  the position of the suggestion words. Directional arrows would be a nice improvement, though.
 - February 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia X10 &&& 4.5&&&Far from Skype&&&This app is usable for English but slow and tracking algorithm is downright terrible opposed to Skype. Slovenian version is especially horrible due to dictionary which is missing even the basic words.
 - May 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Themes are AWESOME.&&&Love the themes and the customization on this, PLUS the fact that it is the closest keyboard out there closest to Swype...only it lags quite a bit on my Epic Touch...and word prediction works a little smoother on swype.. Other than that I love it!! :)
 - January 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Excellent&&&The only keyboard I've liked so far. Works great on Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Super useful for women with small hands who are using larger phones. Rather smart as well. Love that I only have to use the spacebar if typing single character words, i.e., I or A.
 - November 30, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Why is everyone in love with Swype?&&&I like this much better than Swype.  The ability to do swipe, tap, and ABC modes us great.  Even if you don't swipe, the tap keyboard is great.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&WOW&&&Is it just me or is my voice to text working way faster then stock and better. have options of choosing sentances spoken. I wish I would of gotten this sooner. LOVE IT SO MUCH! Moto Triumph
 - January 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Great little app&&&Only annoying thing is it doesn't appear to learn from your typing. If I tell it on ten separate occasions that I want what I typed not its suggested change. It would be nice if it could remember that. Aside from that its great. Way faster! My friends can't keep up LOL
 - January 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Need ability to resize horizontally as well&&&Pretty great but on a tablet, your finger just had to move to much and to far to make swiping across the keyboard very fast.  great that you can currently adjust vertically now but need ability to resize horizontally as well and position on screen where you want.
 - December 16, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&Simply awesome&&&Works flawlessly. Never expected it to be just as good in Hungarian too, but it is. Just great. Worth every penny!
 - July 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Pretty good&&&I quite like it, my volume on ring and sms tone has gone quieter.... Not sure if cause of installation it's a new phone. Hate going backwards on a word, no word options appear, have to delete whole word. Love the skins!
 - January 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 4.5&&&Love it&&&Works good prefer over swype. Wish it had a smiley face button and issues with typing a single letter, doesn't automatically space.
 - February 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&So far the best functional slide keyboard&&&I like the new more than 2 language support. The import/export functionality is essential. I've also tried the Swype Beta and SlideIT is definitely better in all but the actual guessing algorithm. Swype seemed to be more accurate in guessing what I tried to swipe.
 - January 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Very good&&&Very convinuent keyboard. However, I gave 4 statrs for necessity to use an additional drop down menu for switching languages. In my opinion, when you use two lamguages you expect that by clicking of  "international" buttom  languages will be simply switched (i use samsung tablet 10.1)
 - November 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Dell Streak &&& 4.5&&&It just keeps getting better&&&Works great with my Dell Streak using android 2.2.2 Everybody should use it. I wish it had a "Math Language pack".
 - January 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Incredible&&&This is the greatest keyboard app I've ever seen. It works sooooo smoothly and really make it easy to type on the phone. One little complaint though has to do with uppercase first letters which come up randomly with no automatic way to make them lowercase (however, this is not frequent)!
 - May 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Almost perfect&&&It's honestly one of my favorite keyboards because of the customization capabilities.. But it lacks in a few areas. My main thing.. Please make out so the long press can be shorter than 0.25 seconds? Thanks. :)
 - January 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Finally rid of the Swype nuisance&&&Had been using Swype, a memory pig with a dorky distribution model (turning off the keyboard whenever an update is available) and an update process that has never been trouble free for me.  This keyboard is a good alternative.  It doesn't do quite as good a job as Swype in understanding some of my traces, but I still prefer SlideIt to Swype.
 - December 21, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&WOW!&&&I dont know what took me so long to try slideit, but Im happy I did! Ive tried it all: swype, swiftkey, etc. By far SlideIT rocks them all, barely uses system resources compared to swype and swiftkey. Slide when you want, type when you want, resize the keyboard, download new themes (I love the GB and ICS themes) WORTH EVERY PENNY.
 - March 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 4.5&&&Love the way it works.&&&I have tried the go keyboard an couldn't get more than two words it would spell right or not change on me. With this app I have been using it for less than two hours but have only had few words spelt wrong but at least the correct words were in the choice list. Will give it a while of use an review again. But so far love it! It feels right using.
January 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 4.5&&&awesome&&&Droid x2, this is the final thing my Droid needed after rooting. I love it.that simple
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 4.5&&&Much smarter than Swype&&&gets most words right easy to add/delete words & the themes are great, only keyboard I use now
 - December 15, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Excellent Product but have one improvement&&&The only advantage Swype has over this keyboard is if Swype doesnt recognize what you typed it will give you its best guess.  SlideIT will just give you ??  And on Swype if you are typing "That" but you swype over "yjst"  It will know you mean that.  seems like Swype is more intelligent, but SlideIT is an amazing alternative.   Not to mention SlideIT is supported on my Galaxy Nexus.  Swype is not.. :(
 - November 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&love it!!&&&Worth every penny! I can type one handed on a full keyboard... Amazing concept! Very fast and fluid.
 - December 13, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Ray &&& 4.5&&&Great swipe app&&&I love the sweeping on this app, though I do wish it assumed words like 'a' and 'i' were automatically words with a space after.
 - December 16, 2011&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Alternative to Swype - could be better!&&&Could be better!  I get random periods of time where it has a 3 second lag to open the keyboard until I restart the phone.  Judging from reviews this is a common issue with this keyboard.  All other keyboards do not have this lag present.  Needs more intuitive method to use punctuation marks like Swype.  Issue with keyboard not recognizing typing "I" as a new word after just sliding another word.
 - December 13, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&ENGLISH?? I DON'T THINK SO!&&&This app actually works rather well, except in 1 department, which leaves me rather peeved. It claims to use an "English" dictionary, except that it doesn't. It seems to use corrupted, misspelled English, otherwise known as AMERICAN ENGLISH. Where is the proper English dictionary? I don't see it amongst all the other language options available. Until Americans learn to spell words like Colour correctly, this app is of no use to me, nor others wishing to use English correctly! ;)
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Very good keyboard&&&Works fine, great feature to resize the keyboard, good predictions, well done
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 4.5&&&Swype killer&&&Great since swyoe stopped working on my rooted g2. Its better thoough bc it has themes which is what I loved from betterkeyboard app
 - January 15, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Not there yet&&&Accuracy is not good in languages other than English (I've tried German and Hebrew), need to repeat words many times, which makes the whole thing cumbersome and everything but fast.
 - December 2, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&getting better, refinement needed&&&Concept great. But suggested words for the slide you do very bizarre, often giving strange word instead of the really obvious one. Desire froyo
 - December 10, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 4.5&&&Nice keyboard&&&Just a little bug on Persian (Farsi) keyboard, i'll email them! But the rest is cool. Good luck
 - February 20, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Not so great&&&The default predictions are the most prevalent drawback of this app. I find myself sending things completely different than what I thought I typed.  As cool as it is, it's far from efficient when compared to the standard keyboard.  Had the app for 2 months now and the only benefit I saw was when using 1 hand to type, which I never do anyways.  Save your money here.
 - May 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 4.5&&&Good.&&&It's a good keyboard, worth every penny. However, lately I'm getting "Error validating license" message, even though I'm connected to the internet. It's pretty annoying, it usually pops up when texting and often switches typing mode from SlideIT to ABC or vice versa. Anyone with a similar problem? Thx.
 - April 8, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Bad app don't buy&&&This app sucks. Its not any better than what I have on my phone already. Don't buy it you will regret it for sure.
 - January 11, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Not good&&&I using galaxy s2. the galaxy swype is much more better. Wasted my money buying it. Swype is more accurate, more easy to used. Trust me.don't buy it.
 - April 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Confused?&&&I have this downloaded on my touch pad & LOVED it when it was FREE! Brought it & now it doesn't work AS GOOD! SMH!!!  but I still Love it.... o_O
 - January 10, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Not all that comfortable&&&I somehow haven't gotten used to this keyboard.. It's just the same as swype with better customization.. I prefer SwiftKey X now.. Its got awesome predictions. Given a chance I would like to return the app and get my money back.
 - May 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Finally a reasonable price!&&&Rooted Galaxy Tab lost Swype, would never have paid $5.45 for this. Auto correct Works really, really, really, poorly....
 - December 10, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 4.5&&&Pretty good&&&Good keyboard! The feature for removing words from the user dictionary is either non existant or ridiculously hard to access. Needs fixed.
 - December 21, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&It is just OK&&&This application is just better than some of the others in business. The predictions are not always perfect and most often the default prediction shown is not the typical one but a rather unusual word. The most important thing is that it doesn't learn the new words and remember them unless each new word is added manually.
 - December 29, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Samsung Galaxy S - Vibrant&&&Worked for a short while, then out of the blue with app still enabled, stopped working all together. Tried everything, no updates yet. Good app, wish it worked.
 - February 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Good&&&It's good especially when your walking and using one hand. But sometimes makes me delete and retype so much.
 - March 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&By far the best!&&&Works great, by far the best keyboard available on the market.i highly recommend. Keep up the great work. Kudos.
 - December 16, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 4.5&&&Garbage -&&&The dictionary is pathetic and it has loads of trouble getting contractions. Often picks up odd words over common ones (art over at). No error correct
 - December 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 4.5&&&Great&&&This is the first time am using some thing like slideit or swype... It works pretty well in my htc wildfire, accurate and no problems so far.
 - January 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Decent&&&Its a pretty good keyboard seems like an upgraded swipe board, still needs work first letter always comes out as a capital letter cannot fix it
 - December 17, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&GSII&&&Definitely my favourite now. Almost perfect except I get a slight lag everytime it opens... About 3 seconds
 - January 17, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&Accurate but unresponsive&&&I installed it in my galaxy note and tablet. It provides accurate suggestions to words I type but its kinda slow.  Once i turn it to  abc mode, its stop show. And there's no function for it to accommodate my pen for galaxy note.
 - February 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia X10 &&& 4.5&&&Love it. Especially the new custom skin maker add on. But the symbol screen ...&&&Love it. Especially the new custom skin maker add on. But the symbol screen closing after I hit a button, is really REALLY annoying.
 - December 16, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 4.5&&&Better at selecting&&&Words than Swype. But doesn't autospace single letters/numbers like I,a, or any number. Minor issue. Swype is better@capitalization only.
 - June 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 4.5&&&like it a lot&&&it's a great keyboard, but occasionally freezes on htc desire. love the customization, and the number writing pad. prediction could be slightly improved I think. The one thing that would give it 5 stars for me would be the option to have arrow keys or navigation pad - it can be annoying to locate/move through text on hardware with out a d-pad thing - please please add this ! also perhaps option to move graffiti pad to the right.
 - January 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 4.5&&&Works likea dream&&&There only thing I would change would be to be able to resize the width for using on my transformer tablet. A narrower keyboard would be quicker.  love it though
 - March 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 4.5&&&SlideIT&&&This app is great. I had one out two things I would have liked to see, but can't complain. And there is an amazing assortment of skins. Works perfect on my Incredible 2
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 4.5&&&The best keyboard!&&&Better than Swype. Better looks and can be re-sized to suite your needs. Swype and stock Android keyboard are too big for the Gtab 8.9. Also automatically returns to home (letters) keyboard after using a special character. Speeds things up a bunch.
 - December 14, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 4.5&&&forcing myself to try it a few days.&&&I love s w y p e (this keyboard WILL NOT allow me to type their competitors name!!) but this is better than a standard keyboard if you can't get that.
 - April 13, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 4.5&&&Meh.. could be better. I find myself having to correct certain words a lot ...&&&Meh.. could be better. I find myself having to correct certain words a lot when sliding. Tried smart keyboard and really liking it. Uninstall for now
 - January 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 4.5&&&Excellent keyboard&&&I intentionally got the htc desire z because it had a hardware keyboard. I used it almost exclusively until I found slide it. My next phone will not need a hardware keyboard... The customization is tremendous and the accuracy is quite good. Increased my speed of typing by quite a bit. Definitely give it a shot.
 - December 30, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Good but slowwwwww&&&Like how quick it is on typing but has slowed right down when I go to write a text in my message app. Sounds like I have the same issue as Emma has which she posted on 11th December. I have a Galaxy S2 though.  Any ideas anyone?
 - April 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 4.5&&&spacebar alignment issue on tablet&&&great keyboard, but having 4 buttons on its left and 2 on its right, the spacebar looks and feels very decentered on my tablet. please consider readjusting the lower keys layout
 - December 14, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Try it due to promotion&&&Htc desire HD It works even with Indonesian language pack.  It's good but i prefer SwiftKey because i type faster with SwiftKey?.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 4.5&&&Fantastic&&&Very intuitive, simple to use and quickly changing to other languages is a breeze.  Highly recommended.
 - December 14, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Great application&&&Great keyboard. I currently have only one problem with it: In the Slide It keyboard settings I have set it to auto capitalize words in the start of the statement, which is usually what I need. However, there are some cases that I don't want the 1st work to be capitalize, e,g: When writing in a box a user name / Email etc. In this case it capitalize the word, with and without shift. Need to let forcing lower case letter when pressing the shift key and than writing.
 - May 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Brilliant&&&What a keyboard and timesaver for those of us with slow typing speed, as good aas swype and a must for your android, what are you waiting for?
 - January 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Excellent keyboard, but...&&&I like it a lot, but it desperately needs a "default" HTC skin for us HTC Sense users. Also most of the skins currently available on the Market are VERY childish and unpolished (same for the "new generation" skin). Hire a proper graphics artist, Dasur, and start making some PROPER skins. If you do that, you're gonna have the best slide keyboard out there! :)
 - December 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Love this keyboard&&&You can customize it to fit your tastes. But more than that, it's super easy to use and extremely intuitive. The best keyboard I've ever found!
 - February 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 4.5&&&Droid Razr&&&I really like this app even tho you have to buy it if you want to keep using it because it just Stops. There is a few things that need to be worked out tho, such as you really have to watch what is put in for your word because it always seems to add some other word in its place & if you miss a letter you can just add them. Other than a couple other minor problems its a great app.
 - December 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 4.5&&&The best keyboard on market, great support!&&&The keyboard is excellent once you learn its tricks  I bought it a while ago, and sent them an email requesting them to implement the possibility to switch between more than two languages. They replied fast and now they did it.   Highly recommended!
 - January 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 4.5&&&Okay&&&Not bad for typing but it is a bit too strict, especially if you've got fairly thick fingers like me. Also you must add words to the dict before you can get SlideIT to recognize them. Annoying that you can't mass import words.
 - December 14, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Easy to use but no Asian languages and UK English&&&I was using Swype prior to trying out SlideIT. The UI is similar so there is no learning curve - just swipe and go! Good selection of skins as well to cater to different preferences. However, there is no Asian language options, i.e. no Chinese (simplified and traditional), Japanese or Korean. For those I had to download Google IME separately. Even more glaring is the omission of UK English. Hopefully the next updates will bring on board even more language options. In the meantime, keep up the neat work!
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&SlideIT is amazing&&&Skins make it look so much better and its so fast and fun to use! Best $0.10 app yet, I would easily pay full price for it!!!
 - January 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&Awesome keyboard.&&&This keyboard is full if rich features. Lots of skins to choose from and the fact that I can just slide my thumb through the keys to type in a message like this one. Better than Swype! Keep it up!
 - July 3, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Good but not good enough&&&I decided to try this after Swype was freezing in my phone. It's descent but you have to be pretty accurate when sliding otherwise it will never get the word you want. I also feel like the keyboard layout it's too busy, specially the lower row, where the space is. I switched to TouchPal, it's the best app wish better swiping and predictive text like swiftkey
 - February 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 4.5&&&Better than Swype&&&Much better than there default swipe because of the better alternative word options when you swipe incorrectly. Plus there more personalal customization options for you choose from.
 - December 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Works Great&&&I have had no issues thus far. This is far easier and faster than using the default keyboard included with android, especially without a hardware keyboard on my phone (HTC Inspire 4G).
 - January 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Y &&& 4.5&&&Great app, really useful&&&I was worried about typing in my android, I was simply avoiding. Now after slide it it got reversed. I think I am typing little bit too much because it is really fun typing using this app. BUT one hitch I wonder how to type in ALL CAPS. please help me
 - January 18, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Aria &&& 4.5&&&Lost stars after last update.&&&The sensitivity change is good and bad. Awesome on my vizio tablet. But almost UN usable on phone after last update. Usually chooses totally wrong words. Always wants to add s or er or another suffix to every word! Swyping can't be used on that small screen anymore. HTC Aria. Text takes so long with all the correcting every word.
 - January 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.5&&&!&&&So easy and quick, good job. Keyboard does stick on the screen sometimes tho, gets annoying..
 - January 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&too many permissions for a keyboard&&&I got this when it was $0.10 not really paying attention to the permissions.  I refuse to use a keyboard that connects to the internet.  If the permissions are ever updated to address privacy concerns, I would consider using it, because I miss having a swype like keyboard.
April 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Best!&&&Before I bought it I read comments, more people like so I bought it, wow the best there is, one swipe does it all, 5 stars for sure! I am swiping all this what I'm saying!
 - January 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Swype is still better&&&Tried this ap but went back to Swype.  Little things annoyed me.  Single letter words (I, A) would be added to the previous word....very annoying!  Deleting sentences was a letter at a time instead of word at a time.   Holding delete button down wouldn't delete rapidly until you held it down a second time....   I'll stick to Swype.
 - June 8, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.5&&&Slide function stopped working&&&Receiving  "error  message 17" saying that my license cannot be validated, and stops the slide function from working even though I paid for the app.  After reading through other reviews this seems like a common issue lately with no one receiving customer support.  Don't waste you money
 - December 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&I am liking SlideIT very much. Even more as i type this! And the ...&&&I am liking SlideIT very much. Even more as i type this! And the skins are awesome. Yet to try other lang packs. Lástima que ñ sólo funciona pulsando.
 - January 19, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&It's OK.&&&I'm happy with it since I only paid 99p. But its not brilliant. You have up be quite accurate with sliding which takes away from the speed aspect.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 4.5&&&I love it!&&&So beautiful and handy! Smaller than Swype and much better, I think. Hope it will only get better with time.
 - January 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Great&&&Very nice especially now with text to speech.   Now I have the best of both worlds.  Runs smoothly on htc incredible.
 - December 14, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&Galaxy Note crashes&&&Nice layout that facilitates quick typing,  but doesn't work with the note-taking app on Galaxy Note (app crashes).
 - April 14, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Eh...i tried to love it&&&In slide mode sometimes takes forever to type...with all the corrections i could have manually done it in 1/2 the time. I worked with it for 4 months trying to like it...to get to the faces was three extra buttons...and auto correct was was horrible at times. I did like the voice recognition and style
 - March 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 4.5&&&Best keyboard&&&Try the free version and you'll be hooked. Well worth the price! Easy to add and remove words from dictionary, easy to add new languages. Great!
 - January 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG myTouch E739 &&& 4.5&&&I like it a lot&&&I really like it. Swype used to give me fits and I like the simple way to add new words to the dictionary! & the backup and restore option! a few things that bother me but overall I love it!
 - June 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Best keyboard I've tried&&&After my trial finished I switched to using the swype keyboard built into Android. Much much harder to use, I constantly found myself battling with it.  So, I paid for the full version - definitely worth every penny. Correctly guesses what I'm "swyping" pretty much all the time, and "just works" as they say.  Not had any of the other issues I've seen reported.
 - January 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Nice&&&Love swiping! Reliable keyboard. Hard to type in acronyms (extremely frustrating clunkyness to type in capital letters together).
 - January 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Best App on the market!&&&After getting used to writing in swipe mode it becomes simply impossible to even only think of going back to typing! The more you use it, the faster you become! MUST TRY IT to believe it!
 - December 11, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 4.5&&&I like it alot, I just wish there was the smiley editor ability like ...&&&I like it alot, I just wish there was the smiley editor ability like on Better Keyboard. :/ for 10 cents its alright tho. :)
 - January 31, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Very good idea, but needs better dictionary function&&&Really like the skins, but dictionary has entirely to many words that are never needed for texting.... Causing way to many false guesses and users could easily fix this if dictionary was accessible to remove more than one word at a time..... If not for the issue with dictionary I would give 5 stars.
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&The Best&&&This set the bar for all others trying to create slide keyboards. I purchased this after dl-ing the soft version and never tried others. However my bf is willing to prove there has to be an equivalent to slideit (for free) .....I'm still patiently waiting as his patience is almost up with messing around with all the wanna be's.
 - February 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Reason I won't get an iphone.&&&Only complaint is it won't auto space after single letter words. Love this app! Won't switch to iphone because they don't have any sliding keyboards that work as well. And I love the colors and themes. Patiently waiting for St. Patty's day theme.
 - December 15, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Works well on G2x&&&Better prediction than the stock Swype that comes with the phone.  Would be great if one of the symbol layouts had the number keys in a numeric keypad configuration rather than always across the top.
 - March 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Amazingly accurate!&&&This app is very accurate even if you don't quite hit the proper keys, and is easy to correct when it guesses wrong. Saves me a lot of time. Can add custom words and names too. Plenty of free skins to get the look you like. Very glad I bought!
 - January 6, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Swype is better&&&Thought this would be a good Swype substitute because it is easier to install but I was wrong...Swype is so much better...I can't even use this
 - February 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Aria &&& 4.5&&&Best slider app on the market!&&&I have tried other sliders and this is by far the best. No freezing, crashes, locks or drags like I've seen in others. Also LOVE the skin options!
 - December 13, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Not as good as Swype&&&For ten cents i decided to give this app a try, but after about a day of use, I went back to Swype. It is more accurate and just easier to use.
 - December 14, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&Excellent Swype-ing&&&Have tried a few times already and so far, very pleased with it.  Had trouble looking for other characters, though.  So far, an excellent choice for $0.10.  HTC Sensation, Philippine user here.
 - December 21, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Better than swype 3.25?&&&Yes because of it's visual customizations and various user friendly features.... But also no because swype gets the word right more often and is easier to change when it gets it wrong.
January 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Brilliant&&&So much faster than normal typing, recognizes 99% of words straight away. Can't believe I went so long without it.
 - January 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Good - not great ***&&&This is a competent keyboard but tap typing lacks multi touch and swiping is not as intuitive or accurate as swype on my sgs. The saving grace could be the customisation, which has great potential but the skins aren't to my taste. I'm currently double-barrelling my phone with Swiftkey X and Swype, I'd love some updates to change my habits :)
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&A viable competitor to Swype&&&Very much think this app is a true contender. Enjoying it quite immensely on my S2. Smoking deal for 10¢ seems more responsive than swype
 - December 29, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 4.5&&&Great alternative swype keyboard&&&Switching between manual keyboard and slide (swype) is easy. Smiley character is easy to access. Customizable skin option. Takes a while to learn.
 - April 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 4.5&&&Almost perfect...&&&I like the feel of SlideIT over TouchPal, but it has a few problems.  1. SlideIT won't let me switch to upper or lower case in the middle of a word. Also, TouchPal lets me switch the case by selecting the word and tapping the shift key.  2. TouchPal has an editing button for the arrow keys and other tools. SlideIT's arrow keys are 4 clicks deep in the symbols keyboards. 3. SlideIT doesn't have next word prediction.  SlideIT does a lot right, though, and it was worth the price. It's just not perfect, yet.
 - December 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Best keyboard I've tried&&&Coming from swype then from swiftkey, this is hands down the best keyboard for speed texters and typers
 - December 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia X8 &&& 4.5&&&Accurate, quick, customizable&&&It is more accurate than the original one. The Hungarian keyboard is quite good but too many keys showned. The English installation is far better. If you lengthen the tail, it helps you a lot. If you do not like predictive keyboards, SlideIT is for you. Really recommended.
 - December 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 4.5&&&This app is great! I'm using it right notel now, and its also great ...&&&This app is great! I'm using it right notel now, and its also great for school because teachers can't tell what you are doing.
 - February 13, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Galaxy nexus&&&The voice recognition on this app sucks I wish it can use the google voice recognition instead of its own other then that the swype keyboard great
 - November 30, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - LG Pecan &&& 4.5&&&Great time saver!&&&Excellent slide to type application! On the LG Optimus ME it occasionally over estimates my slide pattern, but this is a great help for texters!
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Works good like swipe&&&Comparable to swipe for my experia Ray I'm happy with it since my phones screen is hard to to type on.
 - March 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Feedback&&&Good app , fast and responsive. However, it will be nice if the developers can include chinese in the language packs .;)
 - December 2, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Moment &&& 4.5&&&Amazing!&&&This has got to be the most important app to have.  Now I can beat everyone at typing with only one hand =)
 - December 10, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&ease of use&&&Best slider keyboard i used, I loved the re size keyboard. Pls add support to more frequent words than just predicting
 - December 10, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Good I guess&&&Good replacement for swype, but text predictions fail in comparison with smart keyboard pro
 - December 10, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Good replacement for swype&&&wanted to try this see if it was better than SwiftKey x but no, good thing it was only 10c, it's better than swype but I like SwiftKey x WAY more.
 - January 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&I'm blown away!&&&This is fun and amazing all at once, I love it....
 - December 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Great app!&&&Great app! I think this is at least as good as Swype, if not better!
 - February 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Wow&&&Amazing application. Well worth the money and easy to learn.  blows me away every time I use it. If you text, you gotta get it.
 - February 27, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Ray &&& 4.5&&&could be better for the price&&&SlideIT will not let you capitalize letters in the middle of a wordl, like "iPhone" what reason do they have to block this ability, especially for the high price of the app. also wished voice control worked without having to be connected to the internet.
 - December 14, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 4.5&&&Word prediction is way too simple&&&I don't have too much complain with English but for other language the prediction is almost never correct. I still prefer swiftkey or swype
 - January 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&As good if not better then Swype&&&For the price of 99 cents, you can't go wrong. I've used Swipe for two years, SlideIT has features Swipe does not have and vice versa.
 - December 10, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Terrible. Predictions very inaccurate.&&&I'm quite happy with SwiftKey but wanted a swype-like alternative for when laying in bed when it's hard to hold the phone up.  Very disappointing.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Works really well&&&Compared to swype and swiftkey, thirds works there nest for me. The prediction odd almost always spot on and you don't have to be too accurate. Also no funny like looping for double characters, it worlds it out cleverly itself. Worth it.
 - February 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Excellent app, effortless, good customisation&&&This app just works as-is out of the box, but it can also let you customise it in many ways (skins, languages...) It also scans your contact list and adds the names to your disctionary, so it's easier to swipe the names instead of typing them out. Also, for all of you who use accented languages, there is an option in SlideIT to remove all accents in SMS applications, so as to avoid reducing the number of characters you can send in an SMS, while leaving the accents in emails and office applications. Just this last point is worth the price in my opinion.
 - April 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Error 17&&&Bought full version a while ago.  now for some reason I keep getting an invalid license.
 - January 28, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Love it but...&&&Great product but slows down, freezes my phone, and causes apps to force close and I have to reset my phone. Droid incredible. Please fix!!!
 - December 11, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 4.5&&&It's Poop&&&This is not nearly as good as swype.  Even for only .10 I requested a refund..  lol Go keyboard is just as good, and it's free.  It has nice skins, though...
 - January 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Awesome keyboard considering sake price...&&&Very good for one hand text entry. You just have to carefully proof read messages before sending to avoid hilarious misspellings.
 - December 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Aria &&& 4.5&&&By far the best app for android!&&&This is the bees knees!!! It came to solve the only thing I hated from my touch screen android.  thank you for creating it.  it's just perfect!
 - December 31, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 4.5&&&I like it&&&Sure beats tapping! A few hiccups when using log on fields, but nothing major. Like the voice recognition. I use on Xoom.
 - November 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Best keyboard out there!&&&I like this better than other 'slide' keyboards. In fact  I'm using it now.
 - February 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 4.5&&&V Good but&&&Cool sliding&shortcuts! :-) 2 things; pls can we back up our own shortcut abbreviations? & how abt next word prediction? .
 - December 23, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&An abomination&&&Mad I spent 10 cents this. swype keyboard is better when it worked. This messes up a lot. Messed up 8 times during this review.
 - December 12, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Acer Liquid &&& 4.5&&&Less annoying than Swype (no stupid tutorial pop-ups that you can't disable!), but ...&&&Less annoying than Swype (no stupid tutorial pop-ups that you can't disable!), but some quirks are deal-breakers... I'll be sticking with SwiftKey for now.	Feature I'd really like to see: faster way to delete full words. Swiftkey has the keyboard drag, Swype has the long-press...this just speeds up a bit.
 - January 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Good but Swype is better&&&Have used it for a few weeks but found that swipes needed to be too accurate to allow for fast typing, now back on Swype and its way quicker. Also found it slow to start quite often which is not great when you want to type.
 - May 18, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Cannot beat the competition&&&I gave this keyboard a genuine trial for more than a month, but still slow and painful to use particularly with capitalization. Went back to Swype and the relief was palpable with fast, effortless entry. SlideIT has the parts, but not the 'whole'.
 - July 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Better than stock.&&&Pretty good, but sometimes it has trouble with following my swipe and a quick back out and reentry to the text screen fixes it. I like this a lot and recommend it.
 - April 21, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia X8 &&& 4.5&&&Pretty great, BUT&&&Why is there no further development/updates ? There are bugs that need to be fixed which i have already emailed the developers about, months ago. Also, the dictionaries contain a lot of unnecessary words to start with. I keep finding words to delete which dont make sense at all.  EDIT: HOW about an update? Its been more than 6 months, and there are definitely bugs which needs fixing! (Rating lowered!)
 - January 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 4.5&&&Okay.&&&Recognition seems to get worse the longer I use the app. It doesn't learn words that I have to correct every single time I type them. Graffiti mode never works.
 - April 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Its not working for me&&&it use to work, now it keeps staying in abc mode and everytime i try to change it, it say validation doesnt match..
 - December 14, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 4.5&&&Not so bad&&&It's better than simple android keyboard, but not so good as Swype. It's worse on word prediction, and dictionaries are poor.
 - December 1, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Better&&&It is a great texting app to hve.. I text slow so this is great for me..
 - May 1, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&TouchPal is much better&&&I tried, really tried to get this keyboard to work.  It would miss a lot of the traces and auto correct incorrect words.  Even though I paid for the full version, I am now using TouchPal and it is much more accurate.  And Slideit was better than Swype Beta.
 - January 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Good app&&&SwiftKey stays my favorite, but good indeed.
 - March 3, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&Lost a star . . .&&&Very happy with it on my infuse 4g. But on my galaxy note it's a little laggy. Opens a little slow and lingers a little after I close whatever app I was typing in.  Needs auto caps for double spacing. Some of us older guys double space sentences.
 - January 7, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Frustrating&&&..I spend more time deleting the wrong predicted word when in Slide setting by mistake as to make this app a no brainer uninstall. Slide typing ain't for everyone.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Nice&&&So much faster to type and text now. Loving it. Glad I caught it for 10 cents.
 - December 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Excellent&&&Takes a while to get used to, but it its very nice after that. Makes typing much easier.
 - January 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Fantastic swipe KB&&&Great design for Android phones. There are minor quakes like you have to press Del twice to delete words. Otherwise saves time for me.
 - December 15, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&bad error tolerance&&&Very difficult to use for someone with fat fingers :) the error tolerance of Swype is much better. Force closed a few times on my SGS2. I have already purchased this and can't return it anymore.
 - January 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Used to think SlideIt was great until...&&&Used to think SlideIt was great until I discovered TouchPal.  TouchPal is a robust SlideIt .  Do yourself a favour, if you think SlideIt is good, try TouchPal for a few days.  Then you'll come here and say the same thing.  And since Touchpal is free, now you also realise this isn't a spam message.  Give it a try.  You'll see what I mean.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.5&&&way better than swype!&&&seriously. swype randomly stopped working because of a trial period (annoying), so I gave up on them and found this.. couldn't be happier!! :D
 - December 27, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&OK&&&It is OK, but VERY PICKY. Not a lot of give. Takes about the same time, just makes it easier to text. If I wasn't already hooked on swype from my droid x I wouldn't bother. Stock text is pretty good on galaxy nexus.
 - March 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 4.5&&&A+&&&Using it with the Hebrew pack on Motorola Defy Plus. While I see no real advantage over the stock keyboard when comparing English, the Hebrew sliding is fantastic and works with no flaws.  Just two comments if I may: 1. I bought it under $0.99 sale. The original price ($6 or $7) was too high. Maybe something in between should do the job.  2. While it's a matter of personal taste, I think ALL skins are ok at most. Nothing to write home about.  Overall I gave 5 stars.
 - January 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&love it. only a couple things...&&&If I could change a couple things about SlideIT, I'd make it so it knew to not auto-capitalize on login/username form fields, while retaining the auto-caps for normal message composition. I'd also allow setting a maximum width of the keyboard layout because I find it easier to use on a smaller screen, or on my 7" tablet when rotated to portrait. Letters are just too far apart otherwise, but an option to fix that would be awesome.  I nearly bought SwiftKey instead, but sliding to write is so much faster and more fun for me. It makes writing painless, and makes the Bluetooth keyboard I bought kinda pointless. :)
 - April 10, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Won't validate&&&Loved the free trial so purchased the full version, but they've taken my money and it won't validate the license so I can't use the slide feature. I am still waiting for any response to my multiple e-mails.
 - January 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&Works extremely well on quick texts. But you would need to put long words ...&&&Works extremely well on quick texts. But you would need to put long words in manually.
 - January 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Been using it for months and&&&Never had any problems. Much more accurate typing than the standard keyboard that comes with the phone too. Worth every penny.
 - March 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 4.5&&&the best, but...&&&it could still benefit from having right- and left-keys.. not always so easy to get in the middle of a word to correct it on a touchscreen..
 - April 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Arc &&& 4.5&&&Great product&&&I love it so much but wish it has a support for Thai language. I have to switch keyboard every time I need to use Thai.
 - March 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Needs update&&&I love this keyboard by far the best slide keyboard on the market however we need an update!!
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Better, faster, more accurate&&&Than swype and swiftkey, outstanding speech recognition accuracy. I LOVE It!
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Awesome&&&Amazing keyboard, so intuitive, virtually no learning curve. Love my touch keyboard now.  HTC Incredible
 - March 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Nice!&&&Better than I expected. I tried alot of keypads,and stuck with this one.
 - April 25, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Was good.. Now not&&&When this keyboard first came it was great since I can't use better keyboard on this galaxys2.. But now it takes like 5 Secs to pop up and half the time it force closes and sometimes it freezes my phone for like 5-6 Secs until the force close message pops up.. You guys need to fix this.. I'm not the only with this exact problem...
 - December 18, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 4.5&&&definitely not the best&&&Its true you cant get swype on the market, but this is definitely not a replacement for it. You have to make very precise movements for it to show the correct word, and way too often the pick list at the top also doesnt contain the word I'm looking for. Basically, SlideIT will only offer up what you directly did so if you miss a letter by one pixel it will not even suggest the word which is pretty easy if you have FAT fingers.  Furthermore, the words it does predict are often words you simply would not use every day - example: when i try to enter "does" it comes up "dies" very frequently and if i dont notice i type "i hope she dies" because i obviously say "dies" a lot in everyday life. The performance of the app is not an issue as it does perform exactly as described, but it lacks any sort of inherent intelligence as far as the sliding component figuring out what you actually want to say is concerned.
 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 4.5&&&Dumped SWYPE&&&I loved SWYPE, but it became unusable. Took me longer to SWYPE than it would to tap! Got SlideIT demo, fell in love, purchased full version. WAY better than SWYPE, & I never in a million years thought I would give SWYPE the axe.
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&The best sliding keyboard around.&&&With the new language option, allowing all the languages you need, the skinning... Now it's almost perfect.
 - March 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Swype replacement&&&As the title suggests. Downloaded this to replace the very bloated Swipe app. Great, only thing is, its not sensitive enough on guessing, and it going "??" instead of at least trying gets a bit old. Nonetheless, size and features make it a definite plus.
 - March 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 4.5&&&Fantastic!&&&I've used all of the major texting inputs, some of which are cool but I keep coming back to slideit. Besides the extremely easy setup that walks you through the process step by step, there are many different skins that are free to download. definitely a must have for touch screen phones!!!
 - March 3, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Worst keyboard&&&Horrible. Every other swipe based keyboard is FAR MORE ACCURATE!!!  Also, very clunky interface. I hate it. Waste of a dollar
 - December 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Very good.&&&Works better than any other keyboard I've tried. Also has better support for languages than e.g. Swype.
 - May 23, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 4.5&&&Went from 5 to 1&&&Can't  use it anymore, email support  and nothing!  Says licensing  error...  Fix please  used to use this  app exclusively  now use TouchPal  and swiftkey x
 - December 20, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Its ok...&&&I like it but the word prediction stinks, I have to be really accurate with the slide otherwise it won't pick up the word. Its a good deal for 10 cents, but I'm using Swype mostly.
 - March 15, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Poor at best&&&I don't understand the high reviews for this keyboard. The prediction is terrible ... suggesting words that are not actually words! Slow and lags when opening. Don't even bother actually typing a word...the trouble is not worth it. Stick with Swype or TouchPal.
 - January 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Works like I was hoping it would&&&I noticed some people are concerned about the permissions and full internet access from plugin but I haven't seen it do anything fishy and I heard rumors this was out before swype and seems reputable only complaint is it looks like SlideIT doesn't answer their email or just take ages to do so
 - December 23, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Swype has better word prediction&&&Swype has much better word prediction. Im only using this app until Swype becomes available on the galaxy nexus.
 - December 1, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Without doubt THE keyboard for Android&&&With this last update and the option to back/restore included, this without doubt is THE keyboard for Android! Forget about Swift and Swype, this is what you want and need. It quite simply has everything. More language choices than any other keyboard out there. Multilingual for quick and efficient way how to switch layouts libraries. Option to back up and restore said libraries which is invaluable if you're like me and hop from one nightly build to another!
 - May 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&Better than Swype!&&&I just picked up a new phone that has Swype pre installed...and I'm still coming back to slide it. Perhaps it is because I got used to using this one first but overall I just feel this keyboard predicts better. 5 stars!
 - January 14, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Not a properly behaved ICS app&&&Just ok, not as good as swype. Also, switching back to the stock keyboard requires going into the  settings app, even though you can use the quick switch method to set slideit as the default keyboard.
 - December 21, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 4.5&&&Currently my fav.&&&But I am still not totally convinced. Also, If you don't know your way around a keyboard then this app may not be for you.
 - December 20, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Not quite swype?&&&Used swype for a year, picked this up for 10p. Slideit is less accurate, harder to correct & has poorer prediction but needs much less space/resources
 - January 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 4.5&&&Awesome&&&This is ruefully truly one of the most intuitive apps I have ever come across. Great work by the developers!
 - December 11, 2011&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Not bad in english, but useless in portuguese...&&&In english it seems to work just fine, needing too much precision on the letters selected but with a fair amount of correctness. However when writing in my native language (portuguese) it lacks 2 out of 3 words, just awfull...
 - June 13, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Not awful&&&This is a nice app for thougha who don't have a keyboard like this, butt if compared to to Swype on galaxy s2 it's worse, less accurate, more clutter, recommend sticking with default in comparison
 - December 14, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 4.5&&&Full internet access&&&There is no reason a keyboard needs internet access. I disabled this (using cm7 settings) and all download features still work. Spyware?
 - December 19, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Awesome App however some issues with Android 4.0&&&Sometimes the application freezes when I try to delete text using backspace and the word remains there until I select the built in keyboard.
 - January 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Legend &&& 4.5&&&Works well but has some really annoying bugs!&&&Great keyboard, almost equal with Swiftkey X in my opinion (although predictive text perhaps gives Swiftkey the edge). As for SlideIt though, it works well 90% of the time... but how come when I swype 'WAS' often the only option that comes up is 'WAD'... seriously! And worse still... try swyping 'WE', a common word I thought:P, and you get 'EWE'!! PLEASE FIX!
 - February 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&facilitate switching&&&SlideIT is good except it does not support Chinese IME. However, it will be very helpful if the select language button provide an menu item to change keyboard. Long press on input box is torturing.
 - February 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Very nice&&&Absolutely amazing app...  you should really add Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean language packs
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Great keyboard&&&I was so used to Swype that when I didn't have access to it I looked for an alternative, and found this one. I must say I love it. I'm so used to it now that using swype feels a little odd. I recommend this keyboard, nicely customisable, and the word predictions are pretty accurate
 - March 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Too invasive to keep&&&Why does a keyboard app need to read my contacts and phone number info? No thanks.
 - April 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 4.5&&&Very good&&&I love Swype but the fact that it's not on the market and you have through a thousand hurdles to get it makes slideit better and honestly it's almost as good ... Plus slideit supports themes so you can make it look to your liking
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Europa  &&& 4.5&&&I love SlideIT!!&&&All my keyboards are awful, but SlideIT is so cool than GO keyboard!! There are way more skins / themes and I love it!! <3
 - May 1, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Down below from average&&&Apparently the original SlideIt developer has been dead, other people in the team were not capable to make such any updated version, instead they were assigned to develop more and more eye candy which doesn't make sense when core keyboard functionalities is questionable.
 - December 1, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Awesome!&&&Excellent keyboard. Like this one better than Swype! I've tried other keyboards but keep coming back to SlideIT.
 - December 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Tips&&&Everyone complaining about it not spacing are using it wrong. You need to go into the SlideIT settings and check the box for "AutoSpace when Sliding". I think you may also need to check the "Finish word by sliding" option. Once you lift your finger and start swiping the next word it puts a space in. Also for 'I' and 'A' you just have to hit the 'I' or 'A' key and then lift your finger and start swiping the next word. Really nothing to it.
 - April 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Are you kidding?&&&i keep getting a failed license check!  wtf?  stop it!  i bought this app and YOU WONT LET ME USE IT!!!
 - December 22, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 4.5&&&Troubles with basics&&&O dislike that I can't capitalize things in the same word without spacing then backspacing. Also the auto correct needs to be more user friendly, and keys need to be placed better. otherwise its excellent.
 - March 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.5&&&The BEST.&&&I tried all...slide is like having láser guided artillery with 99% kill rate and all you do is press a few buttons and relax...unless you're in a motivated mindset in which you just speak what you want and it transcribes it  to text for you and you're off to the next task...
 - April 3, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Not what I expected..&&&I had some problems with using the swype part of the keyboard. Also the voice recognition/ dictating sucks (almost never got anything I said right) Not worth 5 bucks.
 - April 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Slides like a dream!&&&Works great, have used for over a year. Love, love, love the ability to personalize it with skins....evo & epic 4G
 - December 14, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Not up to par with swype&&&Certainly not a bad keyboard, but the default skin is ugly and correcting mistakes isn't as easy as with swype. Save your money and go for swype.
 - December 10, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&Not as good as swype but ...&&&I used to use this keyboard and bought it as a show of thanks for turning me on to swiping keyboards. I prefer swype though.
 - February 28, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 4.5&&&Add&&&Chinese please! And really slow and buggy.. Takes so long for it to pop up other than that pretty good. Another update soon?
 - June 13, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Good&&&Nice, but not so hot for rapid switching between languages. Found a free alternative that supports multi-languages better after I changed SIM cards and the license failed and wouldn't update.
 - January 15, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&this keyboard is ok.&&&definitely not worth the price. the swyping is inaccurate and frustrating. its slow and lags. will not recommend to anyone. Swype is much better and it is free.
 - December 12, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Bad keyboard!&&&Hate that I can't disable the space auto correction!!! I just  want the keyboard to suggest words, not correct them when I press space.
 - April 6, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Lackluster&&&I really wanted to like this keyboard but it's just endlessly lackluster. It doesn't space right a lot of the time. It had a lag when swyping. It never gets words right. Just forget this one. there are better keyboards out there.
 - June 20, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&only using it due to no swype.&&&yes, its better using the stock keyboard... but unlike swype, it doesn't "learn" your most frequently used words. For some reason, it doesn't recognize the word "a". Thats very obnoxious when you realize that every time you use the word "a"... the keyboard just attaches "a" to the end of the last word. IE... I kickeda dog.  See whati mean? (oh, it does that with the word "I" also.../ sigh.
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Thank you!&&&Really easy and fun using this keyboard. Awesome app. Also thank you for participating in markets 10c apps event.
 - May 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 4.5&&&working fine somehow&&&could not stop my phones built in task manager from killing this app thus it has been defaulting to a very generic keyboard. have to uninstall/reinstall and set it up over and over.. ugh.. now its not being autokilled by android's task manager. took a lot of hear scratching and magically stopped it somehow! great keyboard!
 - December 13, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 4.5&&&Nice&&&Always thought the standard text prediction was good enough so I was hesitant to try one of these.  Writing this review with SlideIT and have to say I'm impressed.  Will only get better as I get accustom to it.
 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&This is the best keyboard app there is !. I love all the different ...&&&This is the best keyboard app there is !. I love all the different skins too !. Do not use the GO keyboard. It's crap !!
 - April 30, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 4.5&&&Sucks&&&Pales is comparison to other swype boards very uncomfortable, unconventional. Doesn't support swyping with both thumbs, I can type  faster
 - February 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Awesome&&&This is a great app! Highly recommend it! Took me only 5 seconds to write this! Don't miss out on this sale
 - April 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Decent keyboard but...&&&It is ugly as sin. And have to press a button to allow me to caps a letter in the middle of a word is beyond me. Not as fast a Swype, and even though it is skinable its still ugly with the ICS skin.
 - January 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&UNHAPPY&&&This app is cool but after a few days, it stopped working on my phone HTC inspire. Shows it is selected but just doesn't open when I text. Makes phone freeze also :-(
 - May 23, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Little details missing&&&This could be 5* but missing attention to details. Eg. If I want to type "just" it often thinks I want "judy". Needs to be more intelligent to pick the more common word. However SlideIT is still great I use it daily and has amazing custom skins. Please Dev improve its Intel at guessing likely words then I will 5*
 - January 12, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 4.5&&&hated it&&&Buggy, not intuitive at all. Stick with swype, it works way better. This was a waste of time.
 - January 20, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Seriously. More pretty than effective.&&&Was I THAT spoiled with SWYPE?  This app cannot get it right. Seriously!! You have to find workarounds for things it INSISTS on following it's way of talking. Download the demo and try to enter this screen name: LetsReason. I'm not ALLOWED to have capitals in the middle of words?! This should definitely be a Steve Jobs app.
 - June 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Could be better&&&Works reasonably well, but very irritating auto capitalisation behaviour. Doesn't seem to be possible to cancel auto capitalization.
 - January 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Great!&&&Makes typing easier and faster with one hand! Just need some arrow keys to move around the text I've already put in.
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 4.5&&&Cool&&&Could not get it to work on my EVO 3D. But found out later that all you have to do is go to any text screen press and hold down finger and select input settings and select slide it.
 - April 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.5&&&Deena&&&I love this keyboard! Been using it for about a year and never had a problem. Until yesterday. I was getting an error that it was unable to validate my license. I emailed customer support not really expecting a response. I then uninstalled and reinstalled. That fixed it, but then I got a response back from customer support! I recommend SlideIT to everyone! BTW, I tried swype... Wasn't impressed.
 - February 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 4.5&&&Junk&&&Good skins but it sucks at its one purpose. Lags, makes too many random spaces, and guesses odd words when you didnt mis-spell. Smart keyboard pro is way better. Thanks for wasting my $$$. G2X
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 4.5&&&Great..customize-able replacement Keyboard!!&&&I ended up BUYING this app because of how flawless it works, and because there are a TON of keyboard "skins" that can be installed (most r free) ~my~ opinion... its more user friendly than a similar "swiping" keyboard. ;-P
 - February 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Good keyboard&&&I love the ability to switch between languages on the fly, but I prefer the error tolerance of Swype.
 - December 16, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Loved swype but this is what I kept&&&I use this more than swype now. Love it.
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Great App and Service&&&Awesome keyboard and, when I had a small problem, the development team responded almost immediately. Best on the market.
 - January 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 4.5&&&Swiftkey X better&&&I've got slideit and swiftkey and i prefer using swiftkey more because of it's predictions. That said, slideit is still a good keyboard as i can use swipe actions but swiftkey wins it for me.
 - April 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&The only bad thing&&&Is that it inserts auto space and capital letters when you're trying to enter a web address so you have to manually tap out web urls
 - December 14, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Crap&&&Reverting back to stock. Norwegian dict/ prediction sucks. Which is my main language. English works OK » much better. Can't compete with Swype tho
 - March 10, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Casio G'zOne Commando &&& 4.5&&&Okay, but could be better.&&&I have been using this app for 3 months now and switched to swiftkey today. Here are the issues with SlideIT:  1. Capitalization issues such as you are unable to capitalize 'D' in McDonald or anything lower case after a period.  2. Spacing before and after single letter words must be manual.  3. No arrow keys to move the cursor.  4. Slow response at times.  5. No predictive words when swiping.
 - January 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&The best&&&Have tried just about every keyboard and for me this is the very best.
 - January 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 4.5&&&Love it!&&&Its such a fun way to text people and if your out and about you can just tap it. The bit I like is that it don't save slang or shortened words its nice to know =)
 - April 7, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Lacks IQ&&&not as intelligent as swype but does an ok job. It really annoys me how the sterling symbole is three or four keyboard clicks where as the dollar is just one! why not have htem both on the same screen like every other keyboard out there.
 - December 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&lovely app.&&&was using go keyboard, but had to get this at the paltry sum of 10p(!). loving the diff skins, and nice layout, and impressed with the word prediction. bargain!
 - December 13, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 4.5&&&Not bad&&&Not the best keyboard I've used, but for ¢10 it's a deal. Word prediction while sliding leaves something to be desired. Cool skins.
 - January 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&great app&&&only slide app replacement for swype that works even better. I love the shortcuts!
 - December 28, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&good app&&&takes too long to load after you select a text box. also add option to disable auto-correct when typing even in slide mode. sgs2
 - March 15, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 4.5&&&Eh . .&&&Not as good as Swype. Kinda disappointed. Needs some improvements. And what's up with all the unnecessary words?
 - May 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 4.5&&&Pretty decent. Touch pal used to b better, but then they fd it up ...&&&Pretty decent. Touch pal used to b better, but then they fd it up last year and it keeps getting worse and worse.  So now this one seems to b working much better, plus u can't beat 99¢! Also I LOVE all the cool themes available!
 - December 4, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO Shift 4G &&& 4.5&&&Best keyboard on the market! More user-friendly than swype. Only critique is that ...&&&Best keyboard on the market! More user-friendly than swype. Only critique is that it could do a better job of predicting more frequent words.
 - March 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&It is fine, lots of customization, languages etc&&&But a real pain if needed to operate in places with limited or no internet connectivity (e.g. using a wifi tablet and no network around, airplane mode etc). In these cases, "slide" will try to validate license and deactivate until next time online. Then, lots of "license error 17" (maybe caused if one has more than one google account connected to phone? Or when restoring from Titanium Backup?) and the need to uninstall and reinstall- inc. skins, preferences etc...
 - December 14, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&It's got nothing on SwiftKey&&&The swipe style typing is very inaccurate. Web addresses were a pain to enter with auto-space. And the keyboard just felt clunky. Back to SwiftKey.
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 4.5&&&Love this keyboard!&&&I use to use Swype but I uninstalled it after I installed this one! Works great on my OG droid.
 - March 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 4.5&&&Would rate 5 if...&&&Once you get the hang of it you can't imagine texting any other way, however an update to allow a double capital in a word without having to space (ex. McGee)
 - January 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 4.5&&&Great!&&&Makes texting really fast, also  I'm finally able to text with one hand and not worry about dropping my phone.
 - April 14, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 4.5&&&Marketing Error&&&This was a pretty good keyboard when it worked. Recently, it stopped working. It says there is a  licensing error. It asks me to validate the license, but then fails to validate it. It asks me to log into Google (which I am) in order to validate it, but still fails. It says error code 17. I definitely paid for this, so I can't say I'm very pleased. Hopefully they'll fix it before too long.
 - March 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 4.5&&&another one of okay keyboard&&&Just,bought,it  ( when its on offer ) then after so many uncomfortable autocorrect thats drive me crazy. i rather stick with my swype..
 - January 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&Beautiful and accurate.&&&Why only 3 stars then? Because it force closes on my Galaxy note every couple of days.
 - December 15, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Great keyboard except&&&When swiping it will aerospace between words but not when clicking the suggested word. Also the suggestions are missing most words like he's she's etc
 - February 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 4.5&&&Excellent keyboard.&&&Other than some minor lagging problems, this app works perfectly on my Optimus 2x. Some word detection/guessing issues when using my native language (Swedish), but the English keyboard works just fine.
 - February 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Great for one handed typing&&&loving it on my galaxy nexus. took some getting used to but overall great. would be great if there was a shortcut for doing one letter words like "a" or "i".    maybe there is a shortcut but they don't make it readily known
 - December 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 4.5&&&Hmmm idk&&&Great Because 4.01 was terrible now its all better can you add gesture to delete last word like SwiftKey still has a problem writing contractions
 - January 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Love it&&&Far superior to swype, great predictability, has customizable shortcuts and far less memory use then other keyboard apps.
 - February 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 4.5&&&Good app but not perfect&&&The keyboard works well on my Droid 2 Global. It gives me ?? Every once in a while when it doesn't understand something which could be considered good and bad. The keyboard won't allow you to capitalize if two words are together ie MySpace, SalsaShark, GotMilk...lol! Its worth 99 cents just for a fun little change for your keyboard even though its really unecessary. Update: Went back to the stock keyboard using Swype and it fails in comparison. Don't care for the voice recognition.
 - December 27, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Sucks&&&Horrible, wish I could give less than 1 star. Text prediction/ recognition is awful.  Anyone who says they like this better than swype probably works for slide it.
 - June 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Swiftkey 3 is here...&&&....when is our turn for an update? Good, but its about time for an update! I'm paying and expecting improvements back!
 - March 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Hate it&&&This keyboard is retarded! It only gets my slide words right half the time. Swype was so much better with my other droid phone. It isn't programmed to predict your more commonly used words. I can't tell you how many times it put Judy down when I was trying to write just. Who uses the word Judy ever?! I wish I hadn't paid for this app but I was thinking the upgraded version would be better...NOPE!
 - January 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Autocorrect sooo annoying&&&I have turned my autocorrect off and it still continues to incorrectly correct my words ughh And the space bar is too small Worst app ever
 - January 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 4.5&&&Great great great great!&&&The only problem is when selecting a symbol it automatically goes back to the keyboard and I keep having to press the symbols button like a hundred times plzzzzzzz fix or give us an option to turn this on/ off its very very annoying thnks!!!
 - January 18, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&Swype >> slideit&&&Everyone that gives this app more than 2 stars never tried Swype! You have to start on the exact letter and the app fails miserably with longer words. Also you have to be very exact where you move your finger, otherwise it fails and doesn't even give you suggestions... please people, try Swype and be amazed!
 - January 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&Nice&&&Had lags launching, But after rom update lag was gone. Has great skins
 - May 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Great! But..&&&Awesome keyboard, sliding works like a charm!  Would suggest new features such as a num-pad when you only need numbers (like stock ICS) and it shouldnt do auto caps when typing in a password, this is very annoying
 - May 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 4.5&&&Nice BUT!&&&So far I like it and purchased the full version. But here's my gripe. How do you, let's say, enter your password multiple letters and alternating capital letters? this keyboard will not let you enter a capital letter in the middle of a word. LiKe tHis. nor will it let you out of capital letter in the middle if caps is locked. It is a hired annoyance and bad design flaw. If this doesn't get resolved I may have to find an alternative keyboard and hopefully get a refund.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 4.5&&&Nice!&&&Love the different skins, been using Swype for ages, now I think I may uninstall it all together.
 - January 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 4.5&&&Fix the bugs!&&&Horrible lag, caps lock is junk, its made for slow typers. When not in slide mode it still thinks my sliding. Starting to think it was a waste of money. Skins are nice though.
 - June 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 4.5&&&used to love it, now I'm not so sure...&&&got a new phone, and this keyboard is now basically unusable. it treats password fields like regular text fields, meaning no mid-word capitalization, meaning my passwords show up in the suggestions bar as I type. not cool, slideit. time for a new keyboard, I guess... :(
 - March 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Good keyboard&&&It's a good keyboard if you really like the sliding part. It sadly isn't that accurate like Swiftkey .I switched to Swiftkey.
 - December 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Great&&&I've been wanting this app for a long time. Now I got it for 10 cents! I love it!
 - May 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia X8 &&& 4.5&&&Fix licensing issue&&&I purchased the full version of this app, had no problem till today, slide it keeps verifying my license, but it fails to do so, please fix this issue, i still have my receipt of purchase in my gmail as proof, anyways just fix it
 - March 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 4.5&&&LG G2X&&&After plenty of testing in English and BR Portuguese with Go Keyboard, Thumb Keyboard, TouchPal, SwiftKey, and of course the stock Android and Swype keyboards, and this is the best keyboard I've found. Entering text even in portrait mode is smoother than any of the above in either mode. All it needs is smarter prediction.
 - January 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Swype is better&&&Still lacking in the predictive text correction.need to be very accurate with your slide it.bit frustrating.paid app...
 - March 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 4.5&&&Not impressed.&&&You need to be too accurate when swiping on slide-it. Swype is much much better when it comes to being lenient with accuracy. All in all, slide-it doesn't have a good enough algorithm to ignore most of your mistakes. I find myself using swype which is available for free instead of Slide-It.
 - January 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Absolutely fantastic&&&Brilliant App. But I really need Japanese one!!
 - December 17, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Decent&&&Let downs; Letters on the keyboard aren't capitalized when I start writing. Also needs speed v accuracy settings. Annoying notifications
 - January 3, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Better than stock but not that great&&&I really don't care for the functionality of editing the words you've already typed. It either deletes it entirely or spaces out letters if you're adding something onto a word. The app overall seems clunky. I often have to retype words to get them right even on my tablet that has more space. I like it better than the updated SWYPE keyboard though.
 - December 17, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Work with galaxy nexus too&&&I used to use swype but it doesn't support Ics yet. So I switched to slide it. It's working fine with my new galaxy nexus. UI could be prettier.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Best Keyboard I've found!&&&Takes the swipe concept and improves the prediction implementation and one handed operation. Won me over in one day and I've been using swipe for almost a year!
 - April 16, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Used to be great&&&it keeps switching to abc text mode and giving me a market licensing error and tells me im not logged on to my account when i try to validate it. sent the developer an email with no response. deff not worth paying for this aggravation!
 - March 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.5&&&< swype&&&Id kill to have swype back on my phone but I've settled for this. It is 98% exactly like swype. But it's the small things that kill me. Like the no automatic spacing aftera tap. See! Aftera not after a... And ifi change the settings to automatically space I havea hard time correcting words. Ex: changing th to the would look like this th e. The little things man!
 - June 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Good&&&Best Swype replacement compared to others. Not as responsive as Swype, but does well at deciding which word you are sliding. LOVE the skins, however not customizable beyond those. If you're looking to adjust key height, get rid of that annoying top bar, or anything else -move on.
 - February 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Amazing!&&&Blows away my old favorite Swiftkey! Only 2 things could make it better: key sound options, and ability to delete dictionary words. Otherwise, <3!
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&samsung galaxy ll&&&intuitive very responsive unlike go keyboard that may have more features but can't get that right touch just quite don't get it....good job slide it
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Swype is better&&&Correction/recognition is bad compared to swype. Many times I don't get a word at first. SlideIT has more skins but the core functionality could be improved.
 - December 18, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Play &&& 4.5&&&Great kb, very fast!&&&Almost as accurate as swype. Why there is a language switch when only one language installed? PLZ fix
 - April 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 4.5&&&the most efficient app ever&&&I've used SlideIT for a year and it's incredibly user friendly as well as faster than the built in Swipe
 - January 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Please improve on this...&&&Can you please improve the search function for contacts so that it picks up any combination of letters in any location. Currently you have to search for the first few letters of the contact name. Example, if my contact is John Smith, searching Smith wont work, it has to be John. The inbuilt HTC desire hd does it well. Also some cursor arrows would be good. Other than that, love the swipe! Great work.
 - January 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Very good, not perfect&&&Has some issues with spaces, the prediction sometimes chooses bizarre words and a couple of other details prevent this being a fantastic five star app.
 - June 13, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 4.5&&&What happened?&&&This used to be amazing.   For the past couple weeks,  it randomly has letters that won't work.   All day the "a" was dead, yesterday it was the "t" (not a phone issue,  other keyboards were fine)  Really weird and very annoying!
 - April 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 4.5&&&It used to be great&&&Now its slow and continually getting slower until you restart your phone. Support says its a known issue and has declined to provide a fix or ETA for a fix. Save your money.
 - December 9, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Excellent on phone, not so much on tablet&&&SlideIT is the absolute best keyboard for the android phone and I use it solely on my Samsung Prevail, however, it seems like the development is lagging a bit on the tablet.  Since the tablet has such a large screen, the keyboard is just too big to enter text quickly.  It needs the ability to resize horizontally, as well as vertically.  The Swype keyboard does this well, and I use it on my Galaxy Tab 10.1, but I would much rather be using SlideIT.  Please fix this. . . . pretty please . . . . . . .
 - June 19, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Not great&&&Sliding has to be dead on or the keyboard can't figure out what is going on.  spend more time correcting than typing... Makes slide texting suck.
 - January 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&Awesome&&&Priceless ! Never thought sending messages from mobile phone would be so much fun and effortless. No words to express how good this app is... Just love it!
 - January 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Almost perfect&&&I've tried the trial version for 10 days and now bought paid for version. The previous standard keyboard used to make the silliest "corrections" - I find Slide It much more accurate and far quicker. You do need a few days to get used to it.
 - February 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Great app but lacks physical qwerty keyb support&&&I've been using the stock app on my Xperia Pro just because this app doesn't support the physical keyboard and when i use it i don't get any  kind of correction nor prediction. Would give five star if this is feature is added.
 - February 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Great keyboard, spaces out letters and makes them bigger, easy to type with thumb ...&&&Great keyboard, spaces out letters and makes them bigger, easy to type with thumb while driving down the median. LOL
 - December 27, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Sorry guys, but SlideIt no way near Swype.&&&Too many times I get the double question mark '??'. Too many times SlideIt doesn't understand the right word for me. Now that Swype has official Hebrew support, I can really say to SlideIt goodbye and never look back.
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Stunning!&&&I LOVE this app! I can type so much faster with Slide it. predictive choices, tons of options. Plus a wonderful bonus of loads of free keyboard visual choices. Try the trial app! You'll be hooked if you like sliding versus tapping the wrong letter all the time. I bought it before my trial was even over.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung VinsQ(M910) &&& 4.5&&&Love it!&&&I love  this app so much. I find stuff to type just so I can use it.
 - March 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&earlwallace&&&This is the best keyboard app I have used on my droidx.  I just wish I could get the "swype" function to work on my WonderMedia 8650.  The keyboard's animated keys that push in is great for a slow low end tablet.
 - December 17, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Great but!&&&The one problem I have with it is. When I manually type in a word that I want to use the predictive text changes it automatically.
 - May 21, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Good app with flaws&&&This app significantly speeds typing. However there are a few flaws that need attention. One is the ?? U get if u dont slide over the exact letters of the word u want. Very frustrating to have to try the same word multiple times. Two the delete key is too close to m every time i try to type a word starting with m it never works bc the screen detects a touch on the delete key first. Third the language button should be completely removed and increase the size of the voice key
 - January 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Amazing!&&&I speak Indonesian and English, so switching between languages in a sentence is a must and this app is up to the task! Easy to add/ remove words. One suggestion: please add the option of adding words with non-alphabetic characters in them, like "I'd" or "e-mail" or "u2". Excellent job guys!
 - March 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&It would be great if it didn't autocorrect!&&&The keyboard has some great features, but you can't turn off the over-aggressive autocorrect!  When you want to change an autocorrect word, hitting backspace will delete the whole word.  It became a royal pain after a short while.
 - May 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&SlideIt Keyboard&&&I love this new keyboard. In addition to the many features, it also has a variety of keyboard skins to choose from.     I have one problem: How do I set ALL CAPS key? It seems that after I type the letter, I press the ALL CAPS KEY, it doesn't come on. If someone can assist with helping me figure out how to work the ALL CAPS KEY, I will greatly appreciate it.    I'm giving this product 5 Stars!!!!!!!
 - March 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 4.5&&&Tried Them All ...&&&This really is a stellar keyboard. Fast, efficient and Simple. Singe is for teens, Swipe is good but not fast, Asus's native keyboard is Super good , but This stomps them All!
 - May 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Great&&&This is by far the best keyboard app ever. Intuitive and very forgiving even when you don't exactly get the word right, the suggestion list has the word you were looking for. Well worth the money.
 - January 14, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Ok, but not great. The discount was good, so I bought it. But the ...&&&Ok, but not great. The discount was good, so I bought it.  But the word recognition is not even as good as the old ShapeWriter app was. Disappointed.
 - March 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Better than Nothing.&&&Until I down loaded this app, its spared my life from a ton gay   stuff. If had the choice I'd buy two... Butt needs work I still find myself doing alloy alot of thumbing...
 - June 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Simply not as good as Swype.&&&I bought this because I had trouble with my Swype install.  After several months of using it, it just simply is not as good as Swype.  It does not predict words correctly and the dictionary is not as large.  The frustration I had with it led me to format my phone just to get Swype Beta back.
 - January 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 4.5&&&Tried free download and loved it so easy even for an oldie me.&&&
 - December 18, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Needs work.&&&Better than swype because it does more capitalization & apostrophes, but doesn't make context specific suggestions or allow much spelling error!
 - May 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Not good anymore...&&&Takes many seconds to load it, after restart works fine again! I'm using it almost a year now , and some time ago it worked fine. Please update! Was 5 star, now 1. Samsung Galaxy S 2.
 - December 14, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.5&&&Ugh... Bought it for 10¢ and paid too much.&&&The skins are OK, the learning style is terrible. It lost me when I tried to use the speech to text. It would not let me add more than one word a time
 - June 2, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Really need way to edit dictionary&&&Cannot handle apostrophes in words, such as "weren't". Poor predictions. "Again" coming out as "assassin"?! Used to love this keyboard, but lazy developer, never updates.
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Get It&&&This app is so much nicer than the swype keyboard. I'm using the ics theme and I'm in love. Landscape texting is way more accurate. The graffiti feature is awesome. I'm walking around showing it to all my friends and family. My boyfriend can pass a test on this app. I'm naturally excitable , but I'm sure everyone else will love it just as much. Great buy!
 - December 21, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 4.5&&&Cool!&&&Love it! Sure beats the stock, and even tho i already have swype im sure its nice for users who didnt b4 to get it w this app
 - March 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&Excellent except...&&&... You need to fix the bug where we have to manually hit space after "a" and "I". It gets very annoying after a while. Otherwise the best keyboard I've tried!
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Great app, except capital letters in middle of word&&&Really like the app, but can't find a way to put a capital letter in the middle of a word (in a password for example) may be a dealbreaker for me.
 - May 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Love it but Hate one thing&&&Just love this keyboard BUT I hate that when I begin writing I have to use a capital letter so in passwords that begin with lets say "p" I have to write "Pp" and then remove the capital one.... PLEASE FIX
 - December 14, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Very, very, good.&&&Doesn't fail as often as Swype.  Not perfect, but it doesn't seem to get worse with time like Swype.  I hate the looks though. It is very bubbly and the icon looks stupid.  No biggy.
 - February 5, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 4.5&&&The best&&&I thought it was the best but the slide function is useless on ICS.  Went back to T9. Will not spend $5 for a fifteen minute  test any more at Google on any app. I should have learned my lesson on desktop 3D.
 - February 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Neo &&& 4.5&&&Brilliant.&&&Easy to use and better than stock key board. Love the way you can slide or tap to input text at the same time. I can't find a fault other than you have to disable space after tap option or you can't type a series of numbers and letters without it adding spaces when you don't want them, i.e. Passwords. This review written using slide it keyboard.
 - February 17, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Not as good as swipe&&&You have to be much more precise than with swype. doesn't always capitalize first word, as in this sentence. Doesn't always auto space, especially if its an a (had to go back and puta space there). Need work to bea daily driver (there, spacing again). Annoying.
 - January 30, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Not as good as Swype&&&I got this for the slide interface because I lost Swype after upgrading my Samsung Galaxy S to Cyanogenmod. Swype let's you slide for symbol entry and doesn't automatically add a space to all email and website addresses! Tapping the period and sliding in "com" enters ". COM". It also doesn't let you add words with symbols to the dictionary, such as my email address. Finally, although it's nice that it guesses whether you need to repeat a letter, it will guess wrong, especially on words like "too". Swype lets you draw a circle or scratch a letter to indicate you want it repeated. No such feature exists in SlideIt.
 - June 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Arc &&& 4.5&&&Really nice to use&&&Much better than my last swipe style keyboard. Predictive facility and auto features really good. Writing number strings a breeze using Graffiti. Purchased this mins after trying the free version.
 - December 1, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Permissions&&&For the whiners, read the new features list: voice input (record audio) and contact import (access to contacts). Now, go fix your tinfoil cap...
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&After 5 months&&&love it. No hiccups. Works very well. Lg Optimus p500 with ice cream sandwich launcher = awesome
 - May 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&excellent but...&&&i love this keyboard! however, please enhance the start up speed. it is a little laggy
 - December 26, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Backspace is in the wrong place.&&&I want to like this. Like Swype, it uses the sliding-around method of text entry, and it works pretty well. Unfortunately, the backspace is in the wrong place and I just can't get used to it. It's in the lower right, instead of in the upper right where it belongs. I am just too used to reaching up and to the right to backspace, and so this just won't do for me.  If they would make it possible to re-configure the layout of the keyboard so it looks more like a real QWERTY keyboard with backspace in the upper right, space dead center in the middle, and access to the voice dictation button on the primary keyboard, I'd be all over it. As it stands right now, it's a so-so duplicate of the better Swype keyboard.
 - January 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Stratosphere &&& 4.5&&&Handwriting recognition is still horrible.&&&Swipe is good though. Only bought because it's so cheap. I still prefer multiling (free) for the symbols. Can you add the ability to backup settings too?
 - December 11, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Great keyboard&&&Really great keyboard, exclude that I can't make enter key send message with what'sapp
 - December 13, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 4.5&&&Okay, but not perfect.&&&I like this app but it still has some drawbacks. It features some nice options that swype doesn't utilize. I prefer swype though. Droid X.
 - January 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&like swipe better&&&great keyboard but swipe still has small subtleties that make it more functional (punctuation, no autocap password fields, better error correction...) but still a good app
 - April 17, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Its average with some tiny issues.&&&Why does the app has to capitalize every first letter even I don't want it to? Line spacing seems to put a space between everything and I wish  there was a period button for sentences.
 - March 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Love it&&&I love this app, and all the pretty skins you can make your keyboard! I don't know if I would have paid 5.99 for it. But .99 is perfect!
 - February 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Swiping is great&&&I loved ShapeWriter but it was discontinued, Swype is OK but I prefer this one.
 - December 11, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 4.5&&&Best slide keyboard&&&You would be foolish not to buy for .010! most accurate slide keyboard on the market, way better than swype!
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire S &&& 4.5&&&Ace keyboard&&&Whilst I haven't tried any others out there, this is excellent. When you get used to using it you can really go fast!
 - December 16, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&I've tried just about every keyboard out there&&&and hands down this one is the best. I couldn't stand the popup swype used and others weren't accurate enough.
 - May 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 4.5&&&It was better&&&After the recent updates, SlideIt has become worse. My response times from when I click a text box to the keyboard are astronomically longer than other keyboards. If you could fix this, 5 stars. P.S. I'm on a Galaxy S II Skyrocket
 - December 13, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Tasteless choice of fonts, colors & layouts&&&Ugliest keyboard ever! I've tried every keyboard & this is def.  the ugliest ever. It's apps like this that give a bad name to Android quality control
 - December 12, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia X10 &&& 4.5&&&Swype is much better!&&&This is ok but Swype as many more features and is easier to use. I regret buying this app.
May 1, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&License issues now&&&It changes from slide to abc mode after three words then says the license is invalid. I signed into google but it still does not work.
 - April 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&It's ok&&&Don't like it as much as the stock swype keyboard that came with the galaxy S, it is customizable but I can't work out how to stop it from capitalizing the first letter in some text fields? even pressing shift doesn't stop it, I end up having to use a space, then the first letter then go back and delete the space, which is terribly annoying especially in password fields.    Word prediction while sliding is so so, it occasionally comes up with the craziest suggestions or gets stumped over the simplest word gestures. Does it have to keep a separate dictionary than the phone? updating 2 dictionaries with new words is annoying. Again I've had a better experience with the Samsung Swype keyboard. Uninstalling for now but hopefully it will improve in the future...
 - December 23, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Puts ads for free skins in the notification bar&&&Not acceptable. Five stars when they fix that.
 - December 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 4.5&&&Very excellent keyboard&&&Very nice work. 3D skin wins. Looking forward to 3d skin in colors. Great work. 10¢ is deal of the century
 - January 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 4.5&&&First 20 minutes pure mystification.&&&Then I "got" it and wouldn't want to have a Droid without it.  One thumb writing with no typos! Seriously better than the original in portrait mode. My thumb's not long enough for efficient use in landscape.
 - December 10, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Good potential but wasted&&&No match for SwiftKey. The slide is unusable, the tutorial worthless, lacks simultaneous locale support and the dictionary is poorer.
 - April 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Very smart&&&i bought it, but after while just stopped and ask me to validate it. the problem is: the validation doesn't work giving an error. I asked for support and in 3 days the problem was solved. It is the best keyboard I've found. Very smart!
 - December 4, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&Update Lag Issues&&&Great keyboard, but since update the keyboard takes over 3 seconds to come up after tapping a text box - irritating, HTC Sensation.
 - December 26, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&LOVE IT&&&works on he HTC Droid Incredible (Verizon) where Swipe does not.
 - December 6, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 4.5&&&Used to be good&&&Keyboard used to work good now it sucks so bad takes 4 seconds for it to appear. Complete pile of crap and waste if money,  at least swype is freecrap
 - April 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Love it&&&Been using it for months but it started acting up by sayn I need to validate it and kept going back to Abc. I'm reinstalling hopefully. It'll fix it. Functions nice on my Xperia Play.
 - January 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Fastest Android Keyboard&&&This keyboard is not only fast, its much more accurate than Swype. It would be better if it learned your writing style.
 - March 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Almost great&&&I said almost bc from unknown reason I have to keep this app open to be able use its keyboard. It didn't do it before. Please, fix this bug and I'll give you five stars. Thank you.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Excellent&&&Love love love this keyboard. Makes texting and other text input so much easier than bog standard keyboards! Way less errors now and love all features
 - May 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Excellent Keyboard&&&I have truly tried every keyboard on the market and off the market, this is the best hands down! I highly recommend this keyboard to anyone wanting to try slide texting but also for those who do not. Even if you don't want to slide it's ABC keyboard is amazing. Give it a try it is certainly worth it!
December 1, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Angry&&&After buying the keyboard and loving it for the last 4 months, its now telling me i didnt buy it and now wont let me use it
 - December 11, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Looks nice...&&&Swype pulls off the same concept so much more fluidly. SlideIT struggles recognising words. Punctuation badly thought out. Though it does look nicer.
 - December 13, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Spell check sucks&&&Design/layout of board is good. Problem is the spell check and auto correct feature. Its horrible!
 - December 24, 2011&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Buggy and not faster than just tapping&&&This will slow down your text entry. Their graffiti is buggy and the keyboard behavior differs depending on app you're in.
 - December 9, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Casio G'zOne Commando &&& 4.5&&&Great app&&&This is so handy to use but it frequently is way to touchy about its corrections. We comes out Ewe frequently with no correction options to correct
 - March 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Admire &&& 4.5&&&Plus and minuses&&&(If english is the only language you need I much prefer the swype keyboard.)  Slideit pluses: Many languages Many skins I found the voice input to be better than swype in that it offers you several options to choose from.  Minuses: Not as accurate as swype Not as responsive either (the tactile response lacks. Sometimes it doesn't seem to recognize a finger is sliding) I always end up going back to swype except if I'm texting someone in another language.
 - June 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Took a while to get used to it...&&&But now I can't imagine going back to a standard keyboard. It seems to be getting more used to me too!
 - February 18, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Bad&&&Nice
 - January 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 4.5&&&Great&&&Definitely more responsive than swype. Definitely worth the money. The default skin is ugly as hell though, but the classic skin is much better. I just wish it used prediction to understand when you want to enter some words over than others, like its and it's.
 - January 18, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 4.5&&&Not on target&&&I wanted to like this app, hoping it was as good as Swype, but it's not, unfortunately. It works fairly well, if you watch your input like a hawk. I would like something a little more reliable, though, and will keep searching.
 - December 16, 2011&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&the Autocorrect feature is soooooo ANNOYING!!!!!&&&And there is no way to turn it off in the settings. sometimes I get autocorrected by mistake and get really embarrassing corrections. SlideIt, please allow us to turn the stupid AUTOCORRECT off!!!!!!!!
 - December 13, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 4.5&&&Fun app&&&I paid the full original price but I still think it's worth it. It makes typing fun.
 - March 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&I LOVE this keyboard having tried both Swype & Touchpal before it. Devs quick ...&&&I LOVE this keyboard having tried both Swype & Touchpal before it.  Devs quick to respond when I had a prob (Market fault not app).  Highly recommend.
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&The best!&&&Until I downloaded this keyboard software I had just accepted the many data entry mistakes that I made. This changes everything, I am now faster and more accurate than I thought possible on a 7 inch tablet.
 - May 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 4.5&&&Great App!&&&Nice design and sleek look, however it can be a Tad sluggish and the auto cap does not always work at the start of a new sentence. Overall it is a very nice keyboard though.
 - December 10, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Incredible S &&& 4.5&&&Superb!!&&&Smooth, intuitive & fast on HTC ics. If this is ur 1st slide keyboard, u need some time to get it, u'll never go back to tap. Add Chinese 2get 5 stars
 - December 10, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 4.5&&&Still like Swype better...&&&But if your phone didnt come with swype, this is a great alternative...especially if you can get it for 10 cents
 - January 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Memory loss&&&Been having issues on the Droid incredible. Every couple of days it loses all word memory and I need to uninstall and reinstall. It's worth doing though.
 - February 18, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Terrible default predictions.&&&I mean as in every other word seems a random dictionary entry containing a few of the letters you swiped ("as" yields "add" half the time even when you swipe correctly. Try swiping "OS". Can't be done ). impossible to write without a *lot* of user input. Auto caps hardly works. Swipe was bad but this is terrible. Slowest typing ever. PalmOS graffity was faster.
 - December 1, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&The best&&&I've tried all the keyboards out there. Not as cute as the Go keyboard but functions much better. Been using this for months. Worth the $!
 - January 19, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Swype  was better, Purchasing SlideIT was mistake.&&&Swype was accurate and could predict my fingers.  Please don't buy you will regret.
 - February 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - ZTE Blade &&& 4.5&&&Love it!&&&but really difficult on a bus LOL. Thats about the time I revert back to abc mode. Worth my 99p spent! Some great skins available so if typing at night its easier on the eyes but 3D is usually my go-to choice. Well done devs! Will email them direct for new skin idea later.
 - December 10, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&good keyboard&&&good keyboard, i would give it 5 stars if it had numeric keypad and arrows like it is with swiftkey app
 - January 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&what a joke. go with swiftkey x.&&&This keyboard is a joke. The words it predicts are all too often words I have NEVER even heard of. It's as if the dev downloaded every English word EVER USED in the history of English. I liked it over swype in some ways, but just started using a non-swype (slide) keyboard. SWIFTKEY X is the best keyboard and only keyboard I have ever rated 5 stars. It actually predicts the word you want and the next word you will type. It learns from you and gets better the more you text.
 - March 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Not bad&&&I like some of the skins. Default skin is ugly though. Would like option of removing ABD/SlideIT bar. Or option of choosing keyboard sound. A bug: sometimes when i hold backspace key, it does nothing. Deleting entries or words takes forever due to that. Otherwise a great app. Thanks.
 - January 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Tried Everything...this is my top 3&&&SlideIt is a pleasure to use. In terms of accuracy, it takes time to build up your dictionary, but it's well worth it. Right now it's accuracy is comparable to both Swype and Flex T9. What where at has a major edge is in the customizability of its look and feel. Writing on a small keyboard gets old after awhile, that's why SlideIt's wide range of keyboard theme makes a big difference. It's a tough competitive keyboard market, but this one is definitely one my top favorites.
 - January 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Besoin d'une amélioration visuelle&&&L'application est très intuitive, on "slide" pour chaque mot, et la rédaction devient vraiment rapide. Toutefois, les designs qui sont proposés pour le clavier sont vraiment moche. Ceux de SwiftKey sont nettement supérieur, si on pouvait avoir des designs sobre et plus "ICS" ce serait l'idéal.
 - April 12, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5&&&Good but annoying!!&&&Keeps trying to validate my license and keeps failing for internal reasons. Worked fine for a period.
 - November 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Great job.&&&Bloody amazing app. Keep up the good work, Devs.
 - December 13, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Needs Work&&&Works in theory, but requires very specific swipes, interface is big and ugly even with skins, and lacks ability to enter contractions properly.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Behold2 &&& 4.5&&&wow this keyboard is awesome. I love how its way easier to types on ...&&&wow this keyboard is awesome. I love how its way easier to types on now. thanks !
 - January 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 4.5&&&Great app!!&&&I hated using swipe texting now I love it, so easy to use.
 - January 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Works great&&&I was amazed at the accuracy of this app, I was purposely trying to be sloppy and throw it off, and it still got 99 % of the words i was swiping. Great job Devs.
 - December 12, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 4.5&&&Decent&&&I preferred Swype until it started taking up too much space on my phone. This is an adequate replacement.
 - May 31, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 4.5&&&Keeps forgetting words&&&I've had this over a year and somehow after charging it over night my dictionary has lost at least 30 words so far I have counted. Still happens what is going on!
 - May 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&Dissapointed. Keyboard much more intuitive and accurate. It has nice skins but...&&&
 - January 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&good keyboard&&&not quite as forgiving as swype, but supports ice cream on galaxy Nexus, thanks
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.5&&&Great keyboard and service&&&I love this keyboard, best one out there. I also had a problem with it saying to validate my license and I contacted them and within a couple hours it was resolved.
 - December 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 4.5&&&Love it!&&&Excellent swipe, extensive choice different languages for free download (and easy to toggle between on keyboard), and fun skins available for free.  There's no going back to any of the others for me
 - December 10, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Better than default...&&&Very impressed. Excellent prediction, nice size for tablet and great range of skins. 10p absolute bargin!
 - December 15, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&SUCKS !!&&&To be created for convenience Its every but.. The slide feature only works for 3 or 4 letter words.. Predictive and auto correct always wrong booo !!
 - December 2, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Illiterates&&&Awesome app! The best got even better. Hey Morons, the permission is to access your contacts! Duh?
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&the only way to enter text on a touch phone&&&I LOVE this thing! way better than Swype. and they added a dictionary backup! size of the app could be smaller, don't want to move to SD.
 - March 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&A little frustrating&&&I am using the nexus on ics....  The keyboard does some quirky things  lines or "l"'s after words. Does not have that great of suggestions..i  think it will get better over time. I hope. Glad I got it on sale today.
 - January 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&This was an editor's choice??&&&Slow to match words. Mostly wrong. Slow to pop up when clicking a textbox. Cumbersome keys. I only paid 10c for it and I wish I could get it back.. that bad. Galaxy s running latest 2.3
 - January 31, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&I enjoy typing again!&&&Minor annoyances like capital first letters and having to press space for single letters (I & A) are overcome by an engaging quick way to type. I would like pin yin mandarin input as a feature.
 - January 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Mostly better than swype.&&&I mainly bought this because Swype constantly interrupted message compositions with popup instructions. It's comparable to Swype but the auto correct is atrocious. SlideIT shouldn't auto correct if user taps in a word. Also takes up too much space on hard drive.
 - January 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Best&&&The 3D keyboard is genius. It makes a real difference in giving the sense of pushing buttons
 - December 26, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 4.5&&&Still difficult&&&Loved this app until it took me 2 minutes to type the pw to my email (wouldn't undo capital on first letter, then wouldn't let me capitalize other letters.). -Aids Transformer
 - December 25, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 4.5&&&Best freaking keyboard on the market, it is so accurate its scary, I have ...&&&Best freaking keyboard on the market, it is so accurate its scary, I have tried them all and this is by far the best. Good job team!
 - December 23, 2011&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Below average app&&&I hate it. Swype is way better and always while this one gives me a ?? All the time. Waste of .10 cents.
 - December 23, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Swype is so much better&&&It's so imprecise, I have to re-type every other word. The potential is there but there's still quite a bit of work to be done.
 - April 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Nice app&&&I've been using the app for a long time and its amazing, just in general it makes typing much easier. My only problem is recently it's started to ask me to validate my license regardless if it successfully validated already
 - January 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Awesome&&&Works great on my thunderbolt. It is amazing. truly the best keyboard I have ever used. Great job and thank you...
 - January 19, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 4.5&&&Meh....&&&It's built clunky. For some reason it takes 3mb to run the program. For us nexus 1 users that is precious real estate.
 - January 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 4.5&&&<3&&&I truly love this app. I have the droid incredible and it doesn't have swipe which annoyed me. This fixes that annoyance!! Works great and looks good too. Now my keyboard color matches my phone case. :-)
 - March 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Simply The Best !&&&By far best keyboard available on Android, swipe works every time, word correction and storing works just like it should :) and the themes are top notch !
 - December 17, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 4.5&&&Inaccurate. Get Swype.&&&Accurate about 50% of the time. "Learns" none. No caps in slide mode. Symbols/special characters inconvenient. Autocorrect feature downright obnoxious
 - December 1, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Excellent but dictionary is garbage&&&Still a fantastic app. But its biggest flaw is still its terrible dictionary, in all languages. Also it autocorrects words that you TYPE in.
 - June 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Like it alot&&&Its a great keyboard, and you can customize it a lot. But I've had a few problems with the Accuracy of the sliding to text. Other than that its worth the buy! All the skins to customize are free as well and great!
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Xperia X10 Mini Pro &&& 4.5&&&Excellent but....&&&Add so it's able to scan sms etc (like swiftkey) for words, and add option to auto add new words into dictionary. Also, add more symbols and such.
 - January 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 4.5&&&Excellent&&&Great....like changing keyboard to match my moods.
April 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Validation problems&&&I have used this for a year and now I keep getting an error message saying validation failed log into your Google account. I am already logged in? Help I'm using Swype to type this and won't use slide it again until you can fix this problem I paid $6 for this keyboard?
 - May 11, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 4.5&&&Samsung Galaxy Note&&&Unfortunately not Bulgarian voice recognition. Waste of money because it is doing same what my build in keyboard. I need bulgarian support for voice recognition :(
 - June 8, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Admire &&& 4.5&&&?&&&When are you going to update this my phone freezes up when I use your keyboard to type somethingj
 - March 3, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Slower than stock keyboard&&&Too bad, I keep loosing 1 or 2 characters while typing, uninstalled, but I lost my money already please fix
 - April 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&galaxy nexus 4.0.4&&&works well slight improvements could be made.... too lazy to explain what could be done.
 - February 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 4.5&&&love this app&&&so this app is great but my only issue is that I can't seem to disabled the Auto capitalize and it kinda make password entering a pain.
 - March 15, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Okish but needs a lot of improvement.&&&I can compare it with Swype only. It is definitely inferior to Swype. Misses an gets wrong a shitload of words. Has no clue about predicting what word comes next in sentence.  Needs more work. And all this for English. Romanian is almost unusable. Sorry devs but it got that frustrating to use it and led me to this negative review.
 - March 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&I would like to rate higher&&&I don't care for the fact the words offered for spell check aren't words. If it is not the right word that's swyped you have to delete one letter at a time. When it is the correct word its great. I didn't contact developer.
 - April 17, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Excellent when it works&&&It keeps popping up about market licensing error when I'm trying to type. Very annoying.
 - January 15, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Fare, but...&&&Good for those without swype keyboards. Swype sure is more intuitive.
 - January 11, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 4.5&&&awful, get swore instead&&&looks juice but Diane even work. The above should say "looks good but doesn't even work." see my point...
 - December 13, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Galaxy S Plus &&& 4.5&&&Wierd...&&&Used to use swype but its a little older version (2.7***) (didn't like there popout suggestion). thought this would be a good alternative try out but no...cannot type the word "there" ...always shows they're and the swyping needs to be alot more precise in slideIT keyboard. Most important of them all is that is shows the password in suggestion!   Most annoying thing is words like "I" "a" don't get autospaced :(
 - December 10, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&Brilliant&&&Buti can't give ita5 cos it doesn't automatically recognizei anda as new words and inserta space in front of them, love it tho better than swype!
 - December 19, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Meh&&&Works well but the resolution looks horrible on the Galaxy nexus.  I'm using touchpal instead of this as an alternative until Swype gets updated for 4
 - May 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Swype replacement?&&&not quite. can't slide "start" in portrait mode or "starting" for that matter. could stand to be more accurate, but overall not bad. think swype is more solid though.
 - June 23, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 4.5&&&Used to be good&&&Not updated for 7 months now, few bugs such as capitalize only first letter or the whole word (i.e cannot capitalize second letter if the first is small), doesn't learn common words you are typing (keep using same suggestions no matter how many times you typed that word, such as dear becomes dead quite often), seems the Dev stopped working on this app.
 - December 14, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 4.5&&&It's ok.&&&Useful if you want the skins or a different language. It does an awesome job with other languages. I went back to the original swype keyboard.
 - January 18, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Not worth it&&&You have to swype very accurately to get the word you want. Not as smart as it claims. No automatic space on one letter words e.g. A, I
 - January 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Awesome app&&&best android keyboard app in my opinion.
 - January 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 4.5&&&Brilliant work of art&&&Great app the slide from key to key makes perfect sense. Coupled with the iphone skin.. Typing is easy and effortless. Tried others this is the best.
 - March 18, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 4.5&&&sg2. Latest update killed it&&&Latest update killed it.5 seconds delay before the keyboard pull up.... Ugh..... No word from support
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&accurate, fun, better than tapping&&&new to texting. decided to try this app as a demo. liked it and purchased because I can slide faster than I can tap plus its more fun along the way.
 - March 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Useful&&&Great keyboard. Just PLEASE work on Slovenian language pack which is awful.
 - December 11, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 4.5&&&So far, so good&&&Runs alot smoother than swype. The skins are an added bonus.
 - June 19, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 4.5&&&A real shame&&&This app has some great features and in some ways is superior to TomTom on the iPhone, which it has replaced for me. Unfortunately the app crashes and freezes during navigation. The GPS fix is poor too but this may be hardware, but I doubt it as it works perfectly with google maps. When stable this will be excellent.
 - July 4, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Behold2 &&& 4.5&&&doesn't collect info, thats a google warning informing you to know what you ...&&&doesn't collect info, thats a google warning informing you to know what you install,ie; the source. a hacked SlideIT instead of paying would be issue.
 - February 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 4.5&&&Excellent&&&I was sceptical but it works like a charm.
 - January 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Stratosphere &&& 4.5&&&Best keyboard I've used!&&&The skins and the option to actually type things out are great. The hide button alone makes this keyboard worth the money. Most keyboards on the market do not have this feature and tend to stay on the screen after you hit go but this is not one of those. Also, the long press feature is golden. One thing i would change is the the way this keyboard has to uppercase, swype is better. One more complaint is when you type I alone. Sometimes it does not uppercase, and it never spaced automatically. Not perfect.
 - January 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Super app&&&Great app, much better than stock keyboard
 - March 11, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 4.5&&&No......not much better than Swype, with slide it, I constantly have to check for ...&&&No......not much better than Swype, with slide it, I constantly have to check for all of the misspellings because there are so many. I do like the different colored boards though, but anyway Swype hardly ever makes any mistakes no matter how wild my fingers get!
 - January 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.5&&&Finally&&&My htc thunderbolt doesn't have swype type so I found what I was missing. Had Samsung fascinate which allowed me to swype, was already included. Thanks for this!
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Best slide app&&&This app is very good and predictive at what you are writing and I'm a first time user
 - March 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Mini Pro &&& 4.5&&&Please add Hinglish language&&&I want hinglish langyage as well as hindi in slide it keyboard.Please add it to laguages. You can refer xperia mini prp stock keyboard with gesture input for hinglish laguage
 - January 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.5&&&Great the best now I can type fast and faster no problems. Works well ...&&&Great the best now I can type fast and faster no problems. Works well on htc evo 4g. Simple very good. And has the letter ñ. Cool
 - December 14, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5&&&Buggy keyboard&&&On my Galaxy S2 it often takes some time to show. The shift key locks up so I can only get one letter capitalized in a row. The layout makes me,often
 - May 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 4.5&&&love it!&&&slide it is just fantastic. made my texting and emailing so much faster. only one little problem caps lock does not work for consecutive letters, and will not switch fully to allow all caps. other than that it's amazing. get it and enjoy!
 - December 10, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 4.5&&&Rather cool&&&Good and gets its right 95% of the time. Though has problems with spacing using words "A" and "I".
 - March 8, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 4.5&&&junk keyboard&&&this keyboard its terrible there are better keyboards out there sywpe is much better. glad  I only paid 49 cents for this!
 - March 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Legend &&& 4.5&&&Some mistakes&&&Sometimes English or Russian keyboards give strange symbols on letters a, u, i and so on. It adds diacritical points to them.
 - January 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Aria &&& 4.5&&&Not bad&&&Works well but.. Needs more accurate predictions. I like swift key better because its more accurate but this gets the job done. Better than nuance though. Ill use this as my backup keyboard
 - May 17, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 4.5&&&Sliding doesn't work that good&&&The sliding feature of this keyboard isn't intuitive. It's way too slow considering the corrections to be made while using it. Also the need to switch between the tap and sliding modes is frustrating at times. Swype works way better.
 - February 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 4.5&&&Swyper&&&Needed swype on my phones had fascinate but not available when I switched to nexus. Perfect replacement with sale. To keep number/sym press lock in corner...
