 - March 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 13&&&Work in progress&&&While this app is not perfect, it is still a work in progress.  I spent over a month communicating with the developer, Trevor, when I found several issues with this app on my Samsung Fascinate.  He managed to fix every one of them, and he was in constant contact with me.  This app provides a valuable service to anyone who values their privacy.  Please, if you have a problem with this app, contact the developer before complaining and posting a bad review here.  He did WAY more than 99 cents worth of work to get this app working for me.  Every phone is different, and he doesn't have every single one available for testing and debugging.

 - December 3, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia X10 &&& 4 *CMModFix*&&&Purchased to Support the Developer and give thanks&&&As for this mess I don't think anything will come of it because of all the money that's behind Carrier IQ/ATT/T-Mobile and all the other investors/Data miners/Corporations/Software Developers and friends of all involved. The 55 million dollars in investments alone is a lot of hush money for the media/Bloggers. So they will all get on board for a awhile and wag their fingers to make it look good, all the law sues will quietly go away and they will change their names and go on to business as usual and just make it harder to find next time, because of the billions of dollars in data mining there is to be made. So Please rate 5 stars to this guy for his work trying to show us what is going on behind are backs. Although do you really think it will stop?? USA Inc. See what you get for your 2500 to 3500$ two year contract.
