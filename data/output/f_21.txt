 - May 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.4.1&&&Great app and Dev&&&The app works sweet on my Tbolt.  Max is extremely helpful.   He went above and beyond trying to help me with a problem.  Turns out I just needed a new phone.  Max spent 2 days emailing back and forth trying to get it up and running.  Awesome support.  Thanks Max
 - May 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.4.1&&&App and Developer.... Truly Amazing&&&Read about the application.  Was unsure about whether or not to try.  Developer responded to my eMail is less than 5 minutes with answers.  Two more eMails, two more rapid responses.  The app has been installed and seems to be all that was described, and more.  Highly recommend to those that are S-on and tired of having to fastboot new ROMs
 - May 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 2.4.1&&&Awesome&&&Started the day off trying to research how I was going to root my phone and decided to shoot the developer an email. He responded to my first email within a matter of 20 minutes and to say the least was awesome. I have a custom ROM and rooted phone with only taking up around 3 hours of my day. The help is great and the app is great also. You won't be disappointed, buy this app.
 - May 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.4.1&&&No comparison!&&&The best recovery available anywhere. 4ext makes CWM, TWRP, and all others look second rate. This has the best and most comprehensive list of features anywhere, and is under continuous development.
 - May 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.4.1&&&The best!&&&Incredibly useful and convenient app to complement the best recovery. The developer is the most responsive and dedicated I've encountered! Well done!

 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.4.1&&&Great App&&&I am so happy that i actually purchased this app.   Flashing updates and new roms is now effortless. choose the zip, all other flashables, backup, etc... all in one step then sit back and wait for it to finish
 - May 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.4.1&&&Amaze 4 g   S-on&&&Works perfect!! By far the best recovery I used yet. Only wish it worked on more devices.

 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 2.4.1&&&The best&&&HTC evo v 4g on virgin mobile. This recovery works perfectly and is the easiest to use. only recovery that flashes kernels while s-on. I am a cheapo and this is the only app I've ever purchased. Glad I did. Thank you

 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 2.3.6&&&Incredible&&&Best recovery I've used to date across multiple droids. Works flawlessly on my Evo 3d CDMA.  Developer is super active with updates and features. Well worth the small investment to support such a great project.
 - April 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.3.6&&&Works Best on Amaze 4G&&&I used CMW, and modified versions of CWM and TWRP from xboarder. All of them had some issues here and there. 4EXT is the only recovery that has practically everything working. Even flashes boot afterwards if it's bundled in the ROM. Nothing else compares to 4EXT recovery.
 - April 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 2.3.6&&&Excellent!&&&Thank you! 5 stars are not enough to rate this. I really don't understand people rating this anything but 5 stars. Exemplary program, exemplary developer. Thank you again!
 - April 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.3.6&&&ClockworkMOD loses&&&I found 4EXT Recovery Control and Touch Recovery. It works flawlessly! They're continuing updates/upgrades to it for even more functionality. If you've become disappointed in CWM, I recommend you give 4EXT a try. I purchased the CWM Touch Recovery option from within CWM. The CWM Touch Recovery won't/can't mount my 64 GB Sandisk microSD card. I emailed the developer several times and never got a response. They no longer seem interested in their product or their customers.
 - April 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.3.6&&&not very self-explanatory&&&The UI/help needs to be better. I'm new to flashing ROMs and right iof the bat I had the following problems:  - I did a backup, but I have no idea where it was stored on the SDcard. not under /4ext/backup  - The different recovery images are colored in red, blue, etc... and have names like "reference" "RC": there is no explanation about what the colors mean, and only explanation about the type of ROM after you select it, but I was worried about selecting it before understanding  - it said something about setting the timezone but the proposed timezone was off. it said something about changing your rom's timezone? how do I do that? I tihnk it only affects the naming of the backup file?  If I can't find my backup on the SD card, I will get a refund from GooglePlay
 - April 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 2.3.6&&&S on flashers best friend EVO 3d s on&&&This app has replaced fastboot  with twrp 1.0 for all my flashing needs........none of the other recoveries would consistently flash Roms and kernals.....and they needed fastboot to even do that....I'm on synergy b3 and I had no problems flashing booted first time as well as b2....no bootloops or anything....I know this is all do to 4ext recovery....EVO 3d cdma s on.....support these guys they deserve it.......
 - April 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.3.6&&&Innovative Perfection.&&&Woah. This recovery... I first downloaded just to see what all of the hype was about and WOW... IT WAS WORTH IT.

 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 2.3.6&&&Leaves CWM &  TWRP for dead...&&&Amazing.  Functional, feature rich and visually appealing too.  (Could never understand why recovery s/w was so ugly)  Buy this and support the Dev.  They have put obvious effort into it and need to be rewarded.
 - April 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.3.6&&&Touch, many options, and you can even charge the battery while in this recovery. ...&&&Touch, many options,  and you can even charge the battery while in this recovery.   Can you ask for more?   Sorry clockworkmod, you've lost to this recovery.
 - April 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 2.3.6&&&Must have!&&&I'm a complete noob!  It's and all in one, explained what it is, does and can do! Then it does it for you.... and if you have hboot 1.5 and want custom roms and kernels it's as simple as pushing a button!  Awesome recovery!
 - April 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.3.6&&&Best Recovery for Android&&&Buy this now. Support this hero. If not for what he's already amazingly accomplished then foe future device compatibility. Blows Clockwork Mod out of the water. Simply perfect.

 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 2.3.6&&&4EXT > CWM&&&Been using 4EXT for aprox 6 months. It's the best recovery tool for any Nexus One! CWM always failed to correctly partition my SD when using DT a2sd. Backup and recovery work much smoother as well without sd-ext corruption.

 - March 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.3.2&&&Awesome App!&&&Works great. I've flashed 3 different ROMs with no problems at all. The recovery tool is great on it's own but the control app makes it so much more convenient because you don't have to boot into recovery to perform functions. You can check what you need through the app and have it restart into recovery to do everything. It's definitely worth the money and I won't be using any other recovery from now on!
 - March 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.3.2&&&Htc Thunderbolt&&&This is the best recovery ever. It looks like CWR is left in the dust with this new kid in the block. It got me away from outdated cwr. Good job!!

Two days ago I got curious how different Rom Manager is so I bought the premium. I havent spent an hour with it yet, but Im convinced that its not what I want. Besides, Rom Manager BARELY has any support for my Desire HD, my Rom - Android Revolution HD and the worth is that it keeps on forced closing itself. My curiousity proved that 4Ext is NO DOUBT the best recovery in the market!
 - March 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2.8&&&Just Awesome&&&Best recovery app period. Works perfectly on DI2

 - March 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 2.2.5&&&Wow what a great App amazing&&&This app is the best recovery app there is period!!  I am able to have full control of my HTC Desire and use whatever rom I like with 4EXT. This app rocks and just keeps getting better and better with updates. I have full touch control in this app now as well. For those of you who are experimenting with your phone trying out different roms I strongly suggest you buy this one, I was so new and fearful of breaking my phone at first but feel safe using this app, it has never let me down.  Truthfully I would pay £20.00 for this now knowing how good it is. The creator of 4EXT has the user in mind throughout all the app is able to do and I have learnt so much about hacking my phone with 4EXT.  Well Done madmax.
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 2.2.5&&&Brilliant&&&Can't say a bad thing... Perfect :)

 - February 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2.3&&&Makes flashing much easier.&&&The touch based recovery really makes using the recovery a lot less clunky and easier.  I also like the remote control functionality from within the application, so the application will automatically boot into recovery perform a nandroid backup (reboot into recovery) and then boot back into Android.  You can do this manually with free recoveries of course, but it's just a little more clunkier to do rather than from this fine application. The application is regularly updated by the developer.  I recommend buying the app and supporting the developers hard work.   Using HTC Desire (Bravo).
 - February 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 2.2.2&&&Great dev&&&Perfect flashing tool. Regular updates, Dev continues to support older devices like my htc Desire.
