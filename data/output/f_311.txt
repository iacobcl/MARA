 - June 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.2.2&&&Beautiful but...&&&...why does it impose a random keyboard of it's own? The first rule of simplicity is surely not to reinvent the wheel. I use Swype for everything, why should I need to tap letters for this one app? There should at very least be an option to use the normal system keyboard
 - May 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.2.2&&&Beautifully simple&&&I've used many task management apps, but I always go back to the basics, and this does that perfectly. Intuitive UI just doesn't get in the way ever. Maybe some cloud/task syncing option would improve further though?
 - May 31, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.2.2&&&Keyboard&&&Would be perfect if it used the native keyboard instead of its own custom keyboard. A bit annoying if you're used to SwiftKey predictions, Swype or something like that!
 - May 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.2.2&&&Love it&&&Love the app and the ui but with this new update it seems to be a bit slower  Update: The speed is back, yay! Update: Would love to see a widget!
 - May 18, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.2&&&Nice interface but the keyboard is buggy.&&&Lots of error with the built in keyboard. I wish that it would use the system keyboard. Also, it ate one of my list, meaning - I had a list with 17 items! I go back the next day and only 5 of it were left. I am so annoyed! I can't remember all the items on it!
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.2.2&&&Mind=blown (reddit)&&&I wish this app would take off...and please add a feature to sync with my Google account.
 - June 9, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.2.2&&&All form, little function.&&&Simple. Clean. Beautiful. Those are its only redeeming qualities. Keeps losing list entries upon normal exit or [Home] exit. No auto capitalization. Intermittent random blocks appear in lieu of letters. No moveable cursor. Odd number anomaly appears (bottom of list) when list item contains a number (ie., $100) - probably linked to calculator function (silly).  Needs integration with spellcheck. In short, "All form, no function."
 - May 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.2&&&Simply perfect&&&This app is so simple and intuitive, while giving me every features I need. I <3 it, thank you !
 - May 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.2.2&&&Simple and fun to use&&&Wonderful UI and very simple and easy to use. Does the job of creating lists, to-do etc..
 - June 12, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.2.2&&&Potential to be&&&After actually using - please fix the portrait only options and the custom keyboard.
 - May 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.2.2&&&This list is AWESOME!&&&I love this app!  From the ease of use right down to the coolest sounds and animations...the BEST list Ive used!
 - May 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.2.2&&&Need new icon design&&&Please redesign the icon, it look so ugly, i think the first icon design is good, no need to change that
 - June 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC One S &&& 1.2.2&&&Good, not perfect.&&&Good but very buggy, have to reset the app multiple tines as it keeps freezing. Sometimes have to reset my phone too. Can't be my phone as its the only app that this happens for. HTC One S.
 - May 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.2.2&&&Small app&&&Small app but so useful
 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.2&&&Great app!&&&
 - May 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.2.1&&&Widget please!&&&Great interface based on clear for ios, but should add the option of stock keyboard. Also please add a homescreen widget! Until then I will continue to use any.do
 - May 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.2.1&&&Great app overall&&&Pros: Great functionality and great design. Google should hire this guy. Would love to see an HD tablet version of this. Cons: Landscape mode would be nice as well.
 - May 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.2.1&&&Awsome UI&&&Greate the only weakness is only the keyboard.. Oftenly miss type..
 - May 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 1.2.1&&&Gorgeous UI&&&Amazing!
 - May 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2&&&great ui, but...&&&Really like the UI for this app, but there are 2 things that really need to be addressed:  1) no landscape mode 2) hardware keyboard is not recognized at all.  please fix those two items and this app will be 5 stars!
 - May 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.2&&&Really nice&&&However could you please stop asking me if I want to quit, it is a bit obtrusive. Also an option to use the default keyboard will be nice.  Being able to turn the graphics down would also help improve the performance as it is quite slow on even my high performance device.
 - May 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.2&&&Amazing start&&&This app is incredible and is the first I've used that makes it a pleasure to do to-do lists. It needs a few mods urgently though and it will be almost perfect: Sync with Google Tasks; Use native keyboard or use auto correct from system; Backup and restore feature.... Thanks dev for such a genuinely quality app with attention to detail that makes the whole thing shine. Prefer the old icon though - sorry! Please bring it back.... ?
 - May 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.2&&&Very nice GUI easy to figure out BUT&&&8mb (and growing) is not "minimalistic" but is huge for this app it seems. Love the app dev is responsive & open to feedback. Is adding a gaming number system really needed or a step towards bloatware? KISS
May 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.2&&&holy crap this is a good&&&this is how you develop an application interface.  if this app was a game, I would give it a 10 out of 10  for gameplay and controls.  Finally, a list making app that I actually use on a daily basis!
 - May 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.2&&&Great job&&&Fast response on issues on key board. Simple and great looking UI. Recommend you give it a try.
 - May 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2&&&Yes&&&Yes, the best in terms of UI, but need to add backup, sync options..  Problem : When the text exceed some length, its not shown properly..
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.4&&&Beautiful and buttery-smooth&&&The UI design is phenomenal. Everything feels very visceral and natural. Some functionality is lacking that you may miss from other note/lists apps, like syncing, but the developer is hard at work to incorporate all those things you might want.
 - May 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.1.4&&&Great app, fantastic support.&&&Absolutely love the ux. I had some issues initially, but contacted the developer and was treated with a very fast reply. Excellent all-around!
 - May 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.1.4&&&Slick, easy to use but...&&&Really like this program, especially at the price. I like the way it works. The design is easy on the eyes. Could be.better. Does not rotate screen when rotating phone. Also, no voice recognition. This would make entering things less tedious.
 - May 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.4&&&Pretty and efficient&&&Despite being a minimalistic app, it is very intuitive and easy to pick up. Looks to have derived strong inspiration from Clear of Apple's ecosystem. Keyboard could be better. Would love the ability to sync. Amongst the better looking and user-friendly UI in the android marketplace.
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.4&&&Beautiful interface&&&I have started using any excuse possible to use this app as it is a joy for the eyes and runs very smoothly.
 - May 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.4&&&Nice, but export is odd&&&Works well enough. I have problems on HTC One X, but I think that's Sense's fault, a fix would be good though. Also the export by mail just exports the whole list, regardless of what was checked, which seems to be pointless. Holding out for fixes... Here's an update on the export: Exporting to gmail and reading on a phone seems to export the whole list without selections. But exporting to evernote and reading on a PC *does* retain the selections. Which makes this a good app for attendance taking.....
 - May 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.1.4&&&Breathtaking&&&Beautifully designed and makes task management a fun and rewarding experience
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.1.4&&&Beautiful&&&What a fantastic app. Gorgeous UI and smooth animation. Love it. Definitely keeping an eye on this dev for more apps
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.1.4&&&Very cool!&&&Finally, to do lists are fun!
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.4&&&Absolutely beautiful&&&I don't think I'm being overly hyperbolic when I say this is, without question, the best app I have ever used in 3 years of using Android. It looks beautiful, the animations are smooth as anything and it runs fantastically. Great work, and many thanks to the dev. Look forward to seeing what else you bring out! A set of apps with this GUI scheme would be incredible.
 - May 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.1.4&&&Fantastic&&&Love it, so simple to use
 - May 6, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.1.4&&&samsung galaxy s2&&&doesnt save changes or additions made to lists when i leave the app over half of the times attempted. makes it useless. but very pretty and functional apart from this.
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.1.4&&&Beautifully designed, very usable&&&Saw this on reddit and decided to buy it based on the comments. Definitely worth the money, and the author looks on top of suggestions and bugs, like the ability to use android native keyboards.
 - May 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.1.4&&&So beautiful!&&&This app is so fun to use! Makes me actually want to keep better track of tasks. perhaps there will be Swype ability in the future?
 - May 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.4&&&Smooth and Intuitive&&&Love the design like everyone else, just waiting on a few more features like sync and widgets. Very minimalist right now, which isn't all bad.
 - May 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.1.4&&&Great interface&&&I'm highly impressed with the ease and convenience of this app. So simple yet so useful.
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.4&&&Excellent!&&&I wish all android apps werr this polished! Thank you for soing it right! Can you make it sync with Google tasks or Wunderlist? Also need 'set due date'
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.1.4&&&Wow!&&&Verrry impressed!
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.1.4&&&Great interface&&&...but I'd love the ability to use my own keyboard (for swype purposes) and the ability to move the cursor when making list items. Overall a great list app!
 - May 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.4&&&Great&&&All we need is a widget.
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.1.4&&&Nice&&&I'd only ask for google tasks sync :p
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.4&&&Really Well Made&&&Animations are smooth, and really easy interaction. Looking forward to a few updates and it will be perfect.
 - April 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.1.4&&&Would love sync&&&Gorgeous ui. Sync would make it. Also looking forward to Swype support.
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.1.4&&&Everything that a list app should be&&&I wonder why all the others cant seem to hit the spot so well!  It PERFECT!
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.4&&&Unbelievable!&&&Incredible UI. Gorgeous.
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.1.4&&&Awesome&&&Love it. Hopefully this developer cranks out some more apps. Fluid, beautiful, well done
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.1.4&&&This is truly superb&&&Beauitful, great UI, responsive and easily worth the money!
 - May 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.1.4&&&Simple, Fast, Easy&&&This app works! Not a lot of fancy bells and whistles. Just does what it should. MAKES LISTS.  A real innovative UI.  Kinda fun
 - May 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.4&&&Awesome&&&
 - April 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.1.3&&&Excellent, but could use a widget&&&Truly beautiful app, but I'd love to see a widget to keep important lists at the front of my mind on my home screen
 - April 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 1.1.3&&&Awesome!&&&Really awesome app. Just one suggestion. I should be able to use my own keyboard.
 - April 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.1.2&&&cool&&&really cool interface. very proffesional looking. i like it :)
 - April 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Vale la pena&&&Excelente programa visualmente muy agradable, super rápido y con muchos gestos fáciles de recordar y muy útiles.
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - HTC Droid Incredible&&&Works exactly as advertised&&&The video shows you exactly what you're going to get in full, so watch it and choose for your self. Personally, I really like it's interface and think it looks and works really well.  As it is now, you can't use your personal keyboard and are stuck with a not-so-fancy built in one. The dev says that it is a bug with the SDK and is pushing to get it fixed, so full keyboard support should be coming sometime soon.
 - May 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus&&&Best to do app I've used&&&Really simply and easy to use and haven't experienced any bugs or issues. I'd like to see a reminder function for time sensitive tasks, and a widget to use on a home screen would be perfect for this app.  As of right now the app is well worth the price regardless!
 - May 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&&&&&Great Interface - Standard Keyboard&&&The interface and control methods are fantastic.  Needs to be updated to allow other installed keyboards instead of it's default one.  It makes me miss my swype keyboard.
 - May 8, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&&&&&The in-built keyboard makes it a non-stater&&&The in-built keyboard makes it a non-stater for me. Dev has suggested he will be including the native keyboard sometime however.. The rest is very impressive and well-thought out though!
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Motorola Droid X&&&Great Application&&&This is great as it is. If there is one feature I would request, it would be Google Tasks integration.
 - May 12, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 1.2.2&&&nice but hate the keyboard&&&very nice interface but you should be able to use system keyboard!!
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S&&&Amazing&&&Best to-do software I've ever seen, perfectly minimal and beautiful.
 - May 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Motorola Droid II&&&Beautiful&&&Smooth
