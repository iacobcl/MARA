 - May 10, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Disappointed: HTC Amaze; Glacier; Sensation&&&Polite, intelligible requests for support go unanswered. Market licence errors too often prevent access to an app I paid for upon It's initial release. Frankly, I'd like a refund and be done with this fiasco.   Personal struggles aside, the app is quite a ways from being worth a price tag. This app should have undergone extensive beta testing prior to market release, and even then it should have been placed in the market in beta to iron out the kinks. Proceed with caution.
 - April 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.6&&&Most fun app I own.&&&I bought this after becoming incredibly addicted to the lite version. It takes some trial and error but once you get the hang of it you will love it!
 - May 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Rom magic&&&If you have problems, contact the dev. They get back to you quick, and can usually fix it quick too. Putting ur problem here doesn't help u or them. This app rocks!
 - May 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.6&&&Incredible on HTC EVO 3D!&&&Works great you just got to read the manual, and use google for issues. I haven't had many and love this. It's like dual booting my pc!
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.6&&&Pretty awesome app&&&Very nice love having the ability to test ROMs while still being able to keep my current ROM. Brilliant most useful app ever!
 - April 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&Okay but can be better!&&&App does what as its intended but why have an option to set up a kernal name but its not compatible with flashing kernals on rom slots 1,2,3, etc...? Will rate 5 stars once this is fix galaxy nexus LTE Edit: I rated 5 stars dev got back with me fast. Problem is with the Franco Kernal having issues seeing the SD card if flashed through boot manager and they are looking into fixing it thanks.
 - May 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&Just watched the video...&&&....I must say if you flash roms  even twice a month then this app is well worth the $3. Effortlessly switch back and forth between roms, test out new ones and not have to worry about syncing accounts/apps (after the initial install of course) and time saving. This app has my vote as most useful to from flashers for sure
 - May 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Very cool&&&I'm running two of the latest ICS ROMs with no problems.  I did have to install the ROM in slot 1 on my phone to create a nandroid because that's the only way it would install.  I restored the backup of my phone ROM (CleanROM DE 1.4) and installed slot 1 ROM (Ineffabilis Deus 1.0) from the nandroid and can now run either with no problems.
 - May 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&Works great, but...&&&Works great, but the 4x1 widget doesn't switch to the ROM you select with it. It confirms you want to change, then whines about boot.img not flashing
 - May 14, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&Doesn't work&&&Just boots to Google screen then stops when trying to boot a rom from my saved slots, have to pull battery an restore rom from clockwork mod recovery everytime on my galaxy nexus.Constant force closes an crashes.
 - May 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.2.6&&&Bootmanager&&&Love it. A bit of trial and error to get roms working, but when they do its great. switching between 4 different roms without having to wipe. PRICELESS !!!!!
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&Inspiring&&&So much potential that I have to buy it in order to support creativity! I just hope that this app can be used for my future phones! Nevertheless, my second rooted app that I've bought! Thanks for this creating convenience for my insatiable desire to flash roms ; )
 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.2.6&&&Perfect for testing&&&Never had problems testing AOSP roms with this app.Widget is useful but so ugly! Could do with some nice ICS styling (hint hint)
 - May 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&Great app / Great support&&&The app works great and the developers are very quick to respond and help with any problems you may have.
 - June 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Try it @ your own risk&&&I have purchased this app for liking the idea of booting your phone into multiple ROMS. But by just doing setup  of phone ROM I corrupted the bootloader and the phone refused to boot. May be I am doing something wrong. But I watched the video multiple times and followed the steps. I do not need a refund. I like the dev make this app more compatible with various devices and tested before releasing the paid version. This is a great idea and wish it works perfect soon! Kudos for Dev!!
 - May 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Very impressed&&&I have an HTC Sensation running Virtuous Inquisition 4.0.2 Android version 4.0.3 and have no problems with it at all, but wanted to try Opensensation (CyanogenMod 9) , but didn't want to have to flash. Then came across this app and purchased the pro version (for a very reasonable price). I am very glad I did. It works really well and is really responsive on my class 10 micro SD. Very impressed. Great work Devs. As I say, purchased app to support Developers. Great work.
 - June 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.6&&&Didn't work on my DINC&&&But works perfectly on my DROIDX and that's better anyway since the DINC is so easy to flash back and forth anyway.
 - April 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.6&&&Great&&&Latest update will not allow new gummy updates to install/boot. Look forward to it being fixed.
 - April 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.2.6&&&Worth every penny&&&This app is great! It allows me to test new roms before I upgrade to them. Well worth the investment.
 - June 12, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2.6&&&Doesn't work&&&I can't get it to work. HTC EVO 4g.
 - April 26, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.6&&&Needs a lot of work.&&&Initially, this was a great app. I loved the ability to easily flash from within the phone. However, this app is nothing more than a headache anymore. The app was meant to be able to try many different types of roms.. however, I would say around the last 2 or 3 roms I've flashed have resulted in a phone that refused to boot, losing access to recovery completely, and then resulting in a SBF. Everytime. At this point it's way easier to just flash from Clockwork Recovery than it is this app. Less headache, and I usually don't end with a phone that can only be SBF'd. It gets quite annoying when you have to constantly SBF. Maybe it's my luck, but as of now, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone until I see either better ROM compatibility, or just fixing whatever is wrong with the dang app. It's pathetic.
 - May 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.2.6&&&Working great&&&Awesome I hope for kindle fire support, because that Soulas make that device my number one choice
 - May 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.6&&&Awesome concept&&&Works great with GB roms but doesn't seem to play nice with the ICS leak for the Evo 3D
 - June 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.6&&&Unable to install&&&I was unable to install this app on my HTC sensation xe. It said insufficient storage space eventhough I had 400MB in my internal and 15gb in my external drives.
 - June 1, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&Droid Theory???&&&App won't work with all roms like Axiom, fix this and it will be five stars....
 - May 14, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Licensing broken&&&On the Sprint Galaxy Nexus, the app won't do a whole lot. I tell it to install a ROM and it refuses due to a failed license check. That's crap, since I paid for it here. I want this to work, I really do.
 - June 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&No answer&&&developer simply does not answer the e mails, and the sup doesn't work on my fully rooted galaxy nexus
 - June 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&No support&&&I have emailed for support on why trying to restore nandroids freezes my phone and i get no response. Good concept but has too many bugs.
 - June 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.2.6&&&Got a few glitches, but good for what it does&&&Need to get it working on tmobile Samsung galaxy 2.
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&G nex&&&Love this app. The only issue I see is that in the roms that I put on the slot they ask like ten times for super user access for everything.
 - May 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Great App&&&Used this on my HTC EVO 4G with testing and using different rims. Now I have the 4G LTE but the app is not supporting the phone yet. Will give 5 stars when I can use it.
 - April 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.6&&&Very happy&&&Testing many ICS variants I'm slots - Gummy, AOKP. Device - Droid X.
 - July 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&Not working&&&App worked great on previous phone mytouch 4g but on galaxy nexus it works very poorly and no indication that it is being worked on.
 - April 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Quite Useful&&&Didn't work well on my D1 but on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus LTE it works very good so far!

 - April 13, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 3.2.6&&&Nexus one, and thunderbolt&&&Latest version keeps crashing super user on installing roms
 - June 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&I can't register to join the forum!&&&Pls do something about your forum registration. I couldn't register. It always go back to the invalid answer to the bot question even though I tried it at least 10 times all case sensitive.
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.6&&&Awesome tool!!&&&Being able to boot from ROM to ROM is priceless. This app is beast!! Droid x
 - May 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 3.2.6&&&Awesome App&&&As much as it doesn't work on my T-Mobile G2X, I only bought it to support the dev.  Hopefully I'll be able to use it soon though.  Keep up the awesome work!
 - June 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 3.2.6&&&Love it&&&Works perfectly on my D1  Please try and get support for tee SG3,  I will love you forever
 - May 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 3.2.6&&&good app but...&&&Great app, the only problem is that it doesn't sync my sms on the roms I want and that's why I gave it 3 stars
 - April 13, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.6&&&This was good&&&Keep getting install error with ics roms still. Even made a nandroid backup and still a no go please fix

 - June 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.6&&&License check? I PAID.&&&I can't download this app unless I paid for it. Get rid of the broken license check. It says invalid license for no reason.
 - May 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Good job&&&Does what it says....
 - May 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.6&&&Droid razr&&&Works perfectly!
 - April 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.6&&&Top app&&&So good. Learn how to use it and ask devs if needed. Got sense 3.5 and a beta ice on my dhd. Happy customer for months. Cheers
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.6&&&DX&&&AWSOME!
 - June 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.6&&&Problems now&&&Keeps giving me and others different errors when trying to install rom now. Never used to. Hopefully there's a fix soon. Also no response from the dev anymore. 21 days and no return email. That's not good business.
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.5&&&This app is awesome!&&&Perfect solution for my needs.  I occasionally need to boot into a Sense based ROM,but I prefer AOSP ROMs for daily driving.  Was backing up/restoring nandroids to do this and obviously it was taking in excess of 20 minutes each time.    Now I can do it in less than 5!  Plus, I am a flashaholic.  Now I can try every ROM I see without totally wiping my phone each time.  Awesome!!!
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.5&&&Works Great & Excellent Support!&&&Had a problem, contacted support & got a quick response & fix. I'm a very happy customer Droid-X CM7
 - April 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.2.5&&&Good&&&I gave this app five, but I have to make it four for the moment, last app versions crash while loading, often when you have no data, seems like trying to check license. They have the right to check their product, but they need to check those FCs.
 - April 9, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.5&&&Latest update&&&Seems to have broke all rom installs for me. Keeps saying it can't find the boot.img file and its there. I've tried multiple different roms. -Galaxy Nexus
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.5&&&Droid X: Unable to download files&&&Changing my review to: Works great now per latest update!
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.2.5&&&Nice&&&Works perfect for me. Only suggestion would be to have a download progress bar thing instead of just a whole bunch of words in the notification bar
 - April 10, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.5&&&Does not work&&&On razr
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 3.2.5&&&Love it&&&If you take the time to learn for to use it, it is awesome
April 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 3.2.4&&&This app failed my purpose. Doesn't work without Internet.&&&The other day mobile network was down and Wifi. Now that I have multiple Roms installed, wanted to boot to other ROM to see if mobile net works on there. But no this app/developer is so paranoid about unauthorized usage.  You should give the benefit of the doubt to user who purchased your application. If so much paranoid, design/use another method of app validation.  After spending a lot of time I finally made this app to work with 2 ROMs CM7 & MIUI (none of the other ROMs available for my phone worked).
 - April 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.4&&&Quite good but...&&&Will not install rom's into the slots from zips, ONLY from Nandroid/CWM backups. Also I recommend a high speed class card. But a great idea for an app.
 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.4&&&Awesome!&&&This app is very use full when you want to use numerous roms to find best one for your phone.
 - April 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.4&&&what's the dealio?&&&It doesn't seem to work on Nexus 4.04 ROM but this is not my reason for 1 star rating. I've tried to post on the developers site for help but to sign up for an account there you must solve a math problem PLUS a CAPTCHA that is case sensitive and using colored letters/numbers on different colored backgrounds. Well I am COLOR BLIND so I cant even register to get help, my bank doesn't even have that level of security when creating an account!
 - April 9, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2.4&&&2nd EVO and still doesn't work&&&This is the second EVO I try it on, and it still fails to install any Rom.zip in the empty slots
 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2.4&&&Arthur&&&They helped me over Twitter, @init2winitapps or something like that.  They were great to me

 - March 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.3&&&A truly amazing app...&&&Loaded it onto my Tbolt and have been switching ROMs in and out of  the device over the past few days.  It has not worked well with nandroids and I plan to look into this issue, and I've had a couple of ROMs refuse to operate after being loaded into a slot.   However, overall, this is an absolute dream for those of us who would like to sample the wide variety of ROMs available for the Tbolt.  Excellent work!
 - March 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.3&&&great app&&&I've been using boot manager on my Droid X for a couple months and at first i had some issues, but was able to get some help from the dev and got it resolved, it was something i did wrong, great app with great support.  Thanks!
 - February 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.3&&&Freezes upon installing a SD ROM&&&First review I've ever written.  This app does not work as it's advertised.  The app will attempt to install a ROM but never finish the process.  I really don't think it should take over an hour to attempt to install a ROM.  I've tried each ROM slot with different ROMS and never had a successful SD ROM installation.  Unless I can get some support, I'm going to ask for a refund.
 - March 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.3&&&Fantastic&&&First time around it bricked my phone, but it was due to my own mistake (I realized later). I've watched the video review and tried it again and it works flawlessly on my HTC Desire HD. What a fantastic product. Money well spent.
 - March 11, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.2.3&&&Sick of wasting money&&&Install error license check failed... wtf, my CC sure didn't fail, getting really sick of this happening. Purchased this months ago, have yet been able to do one thing this rom says it does.
 - March 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.3&&&Awesome&&&A few bugs here and there, but once I decided to install via backup rather than flashable zip, i had no issues. Awesome app! Love it!
 - March 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.3&&&Broken after update&&&(Gnex) Worked really well until updated. Now roms either do not boot at all or gapps don't flash to the rom correctly. (No setup/welcome screen and market gets server error.)
 - April 30, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.3&&&No longer works&&&shows up as not compatible with latest AOKP. Free version will still download. Money down the drain.
 - March 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.3&&&A MUST for rooted and Excellent Support&&&The app itself is amazing in what it can do.  The dev responded to 3 of my emails all in under 12 hours! For users having problems, just email dev...  Buy...
 - March 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.3&&&Great but&&&Great app but I've been getting lots of errors when flashing new roms...always fails at boot.img.  I thought this was fixed but looks like it came back :(
 - March 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.3&&&Nice&&&Crack flashers dream. Study up and do it right and you won't have any problems. Otherwise, well, this app is capable of some crazy stuff, so if you aren't careful crazy stuff can happen.
 - March 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.3&&&<3&&&This app is wonderful, and extremely useful for checking out new ROMs (without committing too much time to backing up, installing, poking around, then ultimately restoring the backup or pulling over all existing data through TB). Their support was also very helpful in finding a gapps package that worked with CM9 for Galaxy Nexus. :D
 - March 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.3&&&Limited Roms&&&On my GNex,  AOKP,  Crossbreed and Gummy do not work.  BAMF does.
 - April 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.3&&&Flashaholic evo 3d.&&&Must have this. Running mikrunny on phone rom, and two ICS roms in the slots. Ext 2 or 4 works fine for me, must force large boot image.
 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.3&&&I love you&&&Craploads better than Safestrap!
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.2.3&&&Love this App&&&Have enjoyed this app.  Not one to keep the same rom for to long.  This gives me the choice to switch to whatever rom I'm feeling that day.  Great Job!
 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.2.3&&&Good,&&&But takes up a crap load of space on you're sd card.. If there was a way to have somethin like drop box for storing all of your roms, that would be awesome
 - April 9, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.3&&&FAIL&&&App won't update. I was told it was a market issue, but all my other apps update just fine. I had the same issue when trying to buy it. It's the app.
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.2.3&&&Lifesaver!&&&One of, if not the best application available for crackflashers! Works exactly as advertised (if you know what you're doing)! Must have for any root user!
 - March 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.3&&&Excellent&&&This works wonders for us crack flashers. Set up was easy. No problems. Booted into second rom  no lag..Do nandroid before you fire up the app just in case.
 - March 7, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.3&&&Great Idea&&&I like the concept, the app itself looks good and is easy to use. The only problem is nearly all the ROMs I've tried to install just don't work. It's probably due to always flashing the latest and greatest stuff. Maybe this would work better on Gingerbread ROMs. Anyway happy to support the dev and look forward to any updates.
 - March 7, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 3.2.3&&&I found it much easier and quicker to nandroid backup and restore various ROMs. ...&&&I found it much easier and quicker to nandroid backup and restore various ROMs. This app didn't work for me, wasted my money tbh.
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.3&&&Thank you&&&I bought this app a month ago and it never worked, but since this update came out I must say it has saved me allot of time backing up roms and switching
 - April 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.3&&&Great&&&Makes changing roms easy
 - March 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2.3&&&App works great!&&&The app is a great idea overall and allows for the fast switching between ROMs. The syncing of messages and call logs could use a little work, though.  A side note, installs seem to work better using the nandroid method.
 - February 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 3.2.3&&&This app is a monster...&&&3 ROMs at one time. This a app for those who flash phones constantly. Well worth the money...
 - March 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 3.2.3&&&help!&&&Please support the droid 3 I really would like an app like this for duel booting!
 - April 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.3&&&Great App&&&Very nice so much easier to change roms, worth every dime
 - March 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 3.2.3&&&Good idea but many problems...&&&The idea is indeed very good, but the implementation has many problems.  I have tried two AOSP ICS roms and one MIUI ICS. They all boot fine, but none of them have working WiFi. If you flash normally the rom, make a nandroid backup and restore it from there, the WiFi does work. But this is a whole lot of trouble and requires time, making the whole point of the app pretty wasted... I also tried two ICS Sense roms (one Sense 3.6 and another Sense 4.0). None of them even booted. And I have activated the large boot.img and I have also resized the img's... So in conclusion: The app is probably not very suitable if you want to try the most recent roms, which is exactly what most people would want it for. At least now there is a lite version (which did not exist when I bought the app...), so you can test before hand if it works for you. HTC Desire Z (Vision)
 - March 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.3&&&Cool&&&First app I ever bought hope its not a fail. Reallllyyyy laggy. Hopefully they will fix in later releases.
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.2.3&&&A rooted phone Must Have!&&&This app is exactly what I've been looking for....cuz I flash ROMS like a drunk chick at Mardi Gras!
 - April 7, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 3.2.3&&&Not working EVO 3d GSM&&&First attempt and it couldn't write a boot image. As it took so long to install slot 1 the refund period was up. Great idea but not working here.
 - March 21, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.3&&&Getting worse.&&&Terrible. Can't even restore backups to slots anymore. Takes forever and then fails. Unacceptable. Refund me my money, thief.
 - March 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.3&&&Samsung Galaxy Nexus 4G/LTE&&&Works well once you figure out how to install it.  With stock ICS (4.0.2) as the main phone rom I was able to install AOKP.  However, Gapps from the Google website does not work properly.  Will not bring up activation screen.  The app developer has a Boot Manager specific Gapps package on his website that works perfectly.  So Google "Boot Manager GApps" to find the correct verstion to use with Boot Manager.  Now I can play with custom ROMs without the fear of loosing the stock Google Ice Cream Sandwich experience.
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.3&&&Love this app&&&What more I say this thing is what a person who is always flashing Roms needs. Like have five girls to pick from everyday.;)
 - March 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 3.2.3&&&Great app&&&Works great. A must have for those wanting to try out other roms. A flash o halics dream.
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.2.3&&&Brilliant App&&&Works perfectly on my Desire HD after setting force large boot image. Great fun trying out new roms all the time.

 - February 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 3.2.2&&&Simply Outstanding&&&@ tgwaste: I'm running 8 Rom's  plus my phone Rom and switching between them is as easy and fast as a reboot. Keep playing with it and you'll figure it out. Trust me it's worth it.
 - February 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 3.2.2&&&SUPPORT IT&&&I only purchased to support dev on this fantastic idea! Hope you can get it working on T-Mobile G2X soon cause I can't wait to use this app KEEP IT UP DEVS!!! Great idea for people who flash roms everyday
 - February 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 3.2.2&&&Amazing !&&&However, I recommend a big SD card, 16 GB or Greater, while using this app.
 - February 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.2&&&Just Amazing.&&&Amazing app, works beautifully, and when it didn't, customer support was lightning fast to help me with my problem. Wish I could rate it six stars out of five.
 - February 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.2&&&Fantastic App&&&I really don't know why I waited so long to buy this App. I'm a rampant Crack-Flasher, and this is a spectacular way to keep your DD ready and waiting (just a reboot away) AND play with all your other curiousity ROMs at the same time. Spectacular.
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 3.2.2&&&Mytouch 4g&&&One of the best app. Be warn ice cream Rom don't work very well with this. Mytouch 4g
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 3.2.2&&&Works just fine on HTC Inc!&&&Running AOKP m3 off the SD card perfectly! No complaints.
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.2&&&Kernels&&&Kernels don't install on GNex. App says installed successfully, but stock kernel remains. Minor issue. Still 5 stars.
 - February 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.2&&&LTE Gnexus User&&&This app is awesome. I can load as many roms as my 28GB can hold which comes out to 13 if I have no SD data. Using 4 right now and I've had zero issues. I didn't even bother to read how to use it before I started.
 - February 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.2.2&&&INCREDIBLE&&&Extremely impressed by this app.  Worth the money.  Do not recommended to have an SD card smaller than 16GB as images tend to be huge > 2Gb each.
 - February 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.2&&&Absolutely brilliant!&&&What an ingenious app.  Before discovering this app I would backup and restore ROMs, back and forth between my regular ROM and "guest" ROMs.  This brilliant little app makes changing ROMs a quick task.  Great job fellows!  You're on my "most respected Android devs" list.
 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.2&&&Excellent!&&&Had problems in the beginning, but thanks to the great devs and support, I'm fully up and running! Great app, at a low price worth it's weight in gold :)
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.2&&&Fantastic!&&&I loved reading all of the negative reviews for this because it is their own fault. I love this app! It has been working flawlessly! It is the perfect cure for the flashaholic in all of us! best $3 i have ever spent on my phone!
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.2&&&Amazing&&&This is a must have for flashaholics such as myself. Works great on my EVO 3D and the customer service is phenomenal. Honestly the best $3 I ever spent. If you're considering buying this app, then don't wait any longer!
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.2&&&Eliminates/Embraces crack flashing&&&Simply superb, if you like checking out multiple roms and hate reloading your business this is the bees knees, sent from my galaxy nexus running AOKP / cnd / DX / miui / rootzboat.  Simply..liquified butter
 - February 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2.2&&&HTC EVO 4G&&&I couldn't ask for a better app. I'm a backup flashofile. I have 3 roms loaded and ready to go at all times.  This app saves so much time when you are needing to flash back to another rom, it only takes a reboot to switch roms. If you use CWM or Nandroid to backup it can load both.  As long as you know how to backup a rom and follow on screen instructions you can use this app.  This app does exactly what it says it can do and you will thank yourself a thousand times over for finding it.
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.2&&&awesome app&&&works really well easy to switch between roms very helpful and quick responses to problems/bugs reported,
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 3.2.2&&&Awesome app!&&&Best app EVER for people who like flashing ROMs! The Devs are very responsive to questions/issues too!
 - February 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.2&&&Nothing but problems&&&This app has lots of issues. Doesn't work well with gnex.
 - March 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 3.2.2&&&Edit&&&Lost my Incredible so waiting for Rezound support - Fantastic when it works and allows much more potential for modding/flashing roms. Makes life much easier. New feature sets are always welcome although sometimes they break ones that already work, which isn't that unexpected considering the scope of this app. Would recommend to others except don't be disheartened/surprised that it doesn't work with your device for xyz reason (although admittedly it's incredibly frustrating when it doesn't)  - usually gets fixed eventually. Had a rough patch trying to contact devs but nothing to warrant asking for a refund or anything like that......  Perhaps bootmanager UI theming might be in future updates????? The red wasn't really my cup of tea....
 - February 8, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 3.2.2&&&Error&&&Error building boot.img after it says cleaning up. No luck with this app after 20 trys.
 - February 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.2&&&Does what you want it to do&&&The app is relatively easy to use for anyone who is into the rooting scene and flashing custom roms, etc, and works well. They seem to have great customer support as they have text manuals, video tutorials, and even a forum if you need extra help. Recommended.  I wanted this mostly just to flash ICS on my EVO 3D while I waited for it to be more stable (functioning camera, etc) Happy I did so, and can easily switch back to CM7.
 - February 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 3.2.2&&&Love it...&&&Been waiting for something like this to come out.  For anybody who wants to have fast, easy access to multiple ROMs.  This is the ticket.   RA
 - February 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.2&&&Fantastic&&&This app and the support for it is utterly amazing. These guys stand by their stuff and maintain quality!
 - February 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.2&&&Good idea&&&I will keep trying once a month or so and re-rate when it's working with my ics roms
 - February 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2.2&&&Great App&&&Great app for all you flashaholics. Have 5 roms running.
February 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.2&&&It works.&&&It is a little hard to get figured out at first, but once you get it its good
 - February 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.2&&&HTC sensation problems.&&&Works now, amazing app!!!
 - February 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 3.2.2&&&Perfect&&&One of the best programs, Now running 4 Roms on my desire without any issues, including ICS
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.2&&&Fantastic App&&&Love the idea and the implementation DX

 - February 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.2.2&&&Great&&&This is amazing DHD
 - February 13, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.2&&&...&&&wish i could get my money back for this POS app.
 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.2&&&Awesome App&&&
 - February 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.2&&&Awesome!&&&
 - February 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2.2&&&Epic!&&&Needs no more explaining!
 - February 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.1&&&Amazing!&&&Great work, GNex CDMA. Kernels won't install. Indicates success but when ROM is booted its still on the old kernel. It also doesn't indicate what ROM is currently booted properly. When on ANY ROM slot it still says booted to phoneROM.
 - January 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 3.2.1&&&This has to be one of the coolest&&&Apps I have ever seen! Glad I'm not the only person who has thought of this. Wonder if you can copy the boot.img from a nandroid backup, for the person who couldn't set up the phone ROM. 5 stars in spite of any bugs, just too cool
 - February 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.1&&&Must have for crack flashers!&&&You sir, you are an enabler. Thanks! Had a couple hickups and dev was fast and responsive. Top notch support! Worth every penny! Download this app! :-)
 - January 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.1&&&Love it but some problems on my ROM make it unusable&&&When I flash a new rom it breaks phone ROMS wifi :( but other than that it's great every other time
 - January 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.1&&&Great support&&&I have never had a program with such high quality support. This program is great and the support is even better.
 - January 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.1&&&Please read:&&&While I realize that the Motorola Atrix 4G is not on the supported device list, I downloaded this app anyways because I have root as well as an unlocked bootloader. No dice, though, because when I click Setup Phone, it says: "Backup of your boot.img has failed. Please try again." This means that I wouldn't be able to revert to my main ROM later on, so I'm stuck with a non-functional app. I've also tried disabling logging in superuser, but it still doesn't work. I would really appreciate it if the developer added support for the Atrix 4G.
 - January 31, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.1&&&Great app but...&&&Won't boot into roms anymore, and sometines when I try to get back into phone rom in recovery it also doesn't boot, then I need to wipe everything and flash my rom and start from scratch. I don't get it , it was working perfectly yesterday on my GSM galaxy nexus.
 - January 31, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.1&&&Getting tired of..&&&License check failures! I hope this update fixes this. Also needs better ICS support. Every ICS ROM fails to boot into phone/other roms.
 - January 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.1&&&Worth the money!&&&This is awesome. I don't have to wait for CWM to restore a backup to switch back and forth. Perfect and so much quicker!   I had an issue and sent an email to the developer and was contacted within a few hours and the problem was fixed. I REALLY recommend this app. A+ support plus it works great on the Galaxy Nexus Toro.
 - February 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 3.2.1&&&One of the best apps I've installed on my DInc&&&This is a wonderful app to be able to switch ROMs on your phone. The interface is great. I've had a few glitches starting up such as some boot loop issues (could be individual ROMs) and it took me a while to figure out my SD Booster. However, for issues that I did encounter I reached out to the developers and they were very responsive and provided great troubleshooting tips. I've tinkered with this app quite a bit and can now pretty much troubleshoot much of my own issues after having received such great guidance from the developers. I encourage all those that install this app to follow the tutorial posted on the developers web site. The one drawback to the app is that it requires access the network when launched, I understand the need for this to be able to get updates and install new features, however it does lag a bit when I try to switch ROMs on the fly without being connected to WiFi and a weak 3G connection. I can't thank the developers enough for putting together such world class app that gives users flexibility to switch ROMs. Thanks again!
 - May 11, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.2.1&&&Sd card&&&It was great until start getting message on my gallery sd card not mounted or not present
 - February 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.1&&&Flash-a-holic tool!&&&A nice tool to play within different rom installations. Does what it says :D
 - January 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.1&&&Wow!&&&Works perfectly and the developer is incredibly responsive and helpful. Definitely one of the better purchases I've made!

 - February 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2.1&&&A must for flashaholics&&&This app is simply a must. Keeps getting better and better!

 - January 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.1&&&Fantastic!&&&Works great on CDMA Galaxy Nexus!
 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2.1&&&Outstanding&&&My favorite app! Update with infinite slots made a great app Bananas! Awesome work!
 - January 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2.1&&&Wow&&&Amazing app
 - March 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible S &&& 3.2.1&&&Aber&&&Great app Awesome support
 - January 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.2.1&&&Finally works&&&Uninstalled app, deleted all app files, reinstalled and it finally works on my phone.
 - February 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2.1&&&Great&&&Does what it say
 - January 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.2&&&Very helpful for extended testing&&&While it definitely takes some work to get started and to keep running smoothly, I love using this app and having the ability to switch between ROMs. New permissions are for SMS and call log synching in v3.2.
 - January 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2&&&Love the update&&&I need to upgrade and get an even bigger SD card now. Unlimited rom slots now. Thank you. Very nice
 - January 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2&&&Awesome!&&&This let's me switch roms in a flash. Now that it has SMS syncing, I wish I could give it more stars!
 - January 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2&&&Must have!&&&Nexus user. A must have app for anyone looking to use different ROMs. Does everything it says. Worth every penny!
 - January 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2&&&Phenomenal&&&Superb app and support that is second to none. Devs should be proud if what they have accomplished
 - January 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2&&&Finally!&&&GNex support! Missed this from my TBolt. Ten star app if I could!
 - January 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.2&&&No infinite slots&&&Mine hasn't updated. No infinite slots.
 - January 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.2&&&Nice&&&What a great job guys

 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.1.1&&&ICS worked for me&&&ICS installed on SD. Both roms boot right. First try. Works out of the box. Was a little worried to purchase. But no issues. Great work! Sensation 4G
 - January 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.1.1&&&Awesome!&&&Great app, very few bugs. ICS works fine if used as PhoneROM instead of SD ROM.
 - January 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&AMAZING APP!!!&&&You guys did a great job, as I'm now running the latest ICS beta for the DINC2. Thanks so much. :)
 - January 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.1.1&&&Ryan&&&Perfect for flasaholics. Saves so much time over nandroids. Great team and support. Its easy to encounter problems so read the docs and forums
 - January 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.1.1&&&Works Great&&&Really quick to set up, very easy to use. Rocking ICS on my phone rom, sense, miui, and cyanogen as SD Roms. Very smooth and fast in every system. Using an evo 3d with hboot 1.5
 - January 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Works well HTC Desire HD&&&This is the first time i have bought off the market,  and it really is a great app.  You wont be up and running in minutes, well not on the Desire HD anyway. but with a few basic things to remember this app is great. I now have 4 roms installed on a 8gb card and its full now so no 5th rom till i get a 16gb card. This is running Bindroid, ICS beta 6.1 WP7 (miui based) and Coredroid 8.1 (yes the beta 6.1 of ICS does run on boot manger :) For help installing the roms just visit the boot mnager forum Gavin
 - January 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.1.1&&&Received a response not even 20 minutes later to help fix my problem. Great ...&&&Received a response not even 20 minutes later to help fix my problem. Great app that comes with excellent team and support.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Amazing techology&&&When i first bought it and used it my phone got all messed up but i noticed that cm7 requires froyo so i installed liberdy and it worked!! super fast and just amazing!!! Worth every $$
 - January 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.1.1&&&Can't wait for the official update.&&&I have a thunderbolt, I have been using for months, if you're having problems contact the devs, they are extremely responsive and helpful. Don't just rate this app bad because you're dumb and too lazy to contact support.  I have all 4 slots full and fuctional.
 - December 25, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.1.1&&&incredible&&&works just as advertised even has failsafe protection if u install a bad rom and boot it. Saved my phone - thought I had to run a factory reset but the dev told me to just flash update.zip from sdcard/Boot Manager/phoneRom with clockworkmod and my phone was up and running again. excellent app, now I can run ics without much risk :)
 - December 19, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Works just as advertised!&&&Very simple to use once you understand how to root and flash. Developer was very helpful with a minor issue I incountered. Use the forum and use the instructions. Heppy I purchased!!!
 - January 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.1.1&&&Awesome App!!!&&&Must have for people who keep testing custom ROMS. Though initially I was not able to set it correctly on my HTC desire HD. Dev helped promptly and suggested a few settings. Works now. Have Virtuous affinity as phone ROM and ICS beta and MIUI loaded on SD. Switching ROMS is a breeze... Thanks Dev.
 - January 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Great app... but backups should be universal&&&Overall, a superb app.  It is awesome that you can install a phone nandroid backup to any of the SD slots.  However, it would be greatly improved if the backups of the SD slots could be generated back to the nandroid backup location with the same compatibility.  This would allow users to easily move a rom to a different slot, or more importantly, back to the phone.  ... Also, I agree with others that the Market requirement is not user friendly.
 - December 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Great for power users&&&But if you're looking at this, you're rooted, so you already knew that, right? :) I love the fact that I can try ROMs without having to keep track of nandroids. I definitely need to get a larger SD card in addition to faster speed. I can now dabble with ICS Roms (cool to check out, even with app compatibility issues), MIUI and Sense-based. Constant SD access really heats up the card, but that's expected. A BUILT IN SCREENSHOT FUNCTION WOULD ROCK MY PANTS OFF KTHNX
 - January 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.1.1&&&Best purchase ever&&&Okay, I admit, I'm a flash-a-holic.  This has made my life so much better because now I don't need to turn off my phone while installing a new ROM, and I can switch back in less than a minute.  No more extended downtime due to my addiction.  :D
 - December 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.1.1&&&Awesome app, great response.&&&What else can I say? :)
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 3.1.1&&&A flashaholic's dream&&&A great tool for rom addicts and testers.  Great customer support as well, fast reply on a Sunday.
 - January 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.1.1&&&Awesome&&&Very sweet application. Must have for flashaholics. And don't listen to the one stars...you have to be rather dense for this not to work if you can read. Just saying.
 - January 8, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.1.1&&&Requires internet and android market every use&&&I paid for this app, now I would like to be able to use it when I need it, but these devs are greedy, and have made this app DEFECTIVE BY DESIGN. -2 stars. Does not work with most roms, have to restore nandroid to get back to phone rom. -1 star. HTC Thunderbolt.
 - December 11, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 3.1.1&&&Works great&&&Running Runnymede AIO on my Desire with ICS Beta and my old stock froyo on the sdcard and can boot between them all really quickly. Love it.
 - January 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&awesome but wish it worked on SGN&&&I used it a total of 1 week on my thunderbolt till i got the samsung galaxy nexus and no support for the ph0one =( i wish there way a way to get it to work...  have each OS in its own folder and then creat a symbolic link to each one and mount the appropriate folders ? i dunno but there has to be a work around...
 - January 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.1.1&&&Great&&&Guys, if a ROM doesn't boot you don't need restore a nandroid backup. You just have to flash the phone ROM boot image in the boot manager folder which takes 2 seconds to flash. Don't give a bad rating because you don't know what you're doing..
 - January 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.1.1&&&Works great on HTC EVO 3D&&&Most Roms I flash work great with the exception of a few ics builds, this makes it easy to test out roms fully then go back to a functional sense ROM when I need it, so worth the money keep up the good work
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Michael is doing something wrong on his DX&&&Like Michael, I am running Boot Manager on DX with MIUI as my phone ROM.  I have since installed three additional ROMs have no problems whatsoever. The MIUI is very responsive and lag time on my SD card is rarely noticeable.  The only time I had a boot loop problem was when I installed CM7.  As it turns out, this was my error.  I have installed it correctly and it to works well!
 - January 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Great app&&&Recently purchased, and installed. I have a Class 4 SD card, and I am having no issues with this app.  I was having an issue booting back into my phone ROM after booting into my slot 1 ROM.  This was easily fixed by the app that had tools built in to fix this.  Their site (user guide) is also a good resource. Well worth the money to me.
 - December 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.1.1&&&Very nice&&&Finally figured it out and its the greatest app on my phone
 - December 7, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Most Useful, Amazing apps out there&&&I had purchased this a while back, never really gave it a shot after I could not get it to work properly the first time.  I asked the developer for support he worked with me until all of my questions were answered and was very speedy in response.  This is a must have app for anyone flashing new roms often, and is well worth the price.  I can easily switch between my daily driver (which I run from emmc and have no lag) and other roms I am testing out for fun.

 - December 3, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.1.1&&&Ics support&&&I love the app but found out that when ics is the phone rom the app fc's when trying to boot an SD rom. Yet if ics is the SD rom reboot fine??

 - December 19, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Save your money and more importantly your time&&&Boot loops on DX for any ROM installed in any slot. Phone ROM is MIUI. If you can get it to boot it is totally unresponsive. My time is valuable and un-working software that causes me to waste that time is not forgivable. And yes I read the manual and all the pages I could fins on this thing.
 - January 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.1.1&&&Excellent on Desire HD&&&Simply a great app once you know how to use it. I initially had a few problems with the phone freezing on the htc screen. I emailed the dev, they got back very quickly. This solved my problem. Just had to select Force Large Boot.img from settings. When installing a new Rom, select to clear all 3 options. After installing Rom, go back to Phone Rom and select Setup Phone. Then go back to any Rom and hit Boot Rom! I have CyanogenMod 7.1.0 Stable as my Phone Rom, Latest Miui in slot one and BeatMod ICS 6.2 beta in slot 2. All of them work flawlessly. :-)

I bought this app a few months ago and promptly uninstalled it when nothing was working the way I wanted. 2 days ago I decided to give this another whirl. I spent the money, and I was going to make it worthwhile. On my Thunderbolt, I am running Team BAMF's SoaB as my phone ROM and Cyanogen Mod and ICS on my SD. The switching is seamless. I love it!!! Great app...you won't regret it!

This app has the honor of being the first one that I've purchased. After that, I have not at all regretted it one bit. Totally worth it. Developers are responsive as heck and really care about their work.	It runs really well, even from a class 2 SD card. I was amazed at that really. Now that you can restore from nandroids, this app is near perfect =)

Running on Droid X with a 32GB Class 10 sd card with no problems.  Had some issues setting up with Liquid 3.1 as phone rom and after I couldn't get it setup I contacted them through email and they worked with me until the problem was resolved.  Now running Liquid 3.1 as phone rom with RevNumbers Cm7 11/5 and Vortex RC1 as slot roms and getting ready to install Liberty 3!  Have also flashed Powerboost 2.0.2 and Jakebytes 14 through Boot Manager successfully!  Great!
 - November 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.3&&&Excellent app & support but be prepared to tinker&&&The app is an excellent platform to test alternate roms though not all will install. The customer support via email is outstanding. I had an issue with the new version and my concern was addressed immediately. The developer shared the latest beta copy with me which resolved my issue and adds additional functionality, so stay tuned as there will be a market update soon. Before installation make a nandroid backup as you may need it to restore your boot image if things go wrong.

I have read the manual over and over. I have disabled logging in the superuser app. My success rate on my htc Thunderbolt has even gotten worse with version 3.0.3 which is at 0 for 6 or 7 today! The normal outcome of flashing a zip is a long wait and a reboot into the phone rom. This evening on the 6th or 7th failure of the day it rebooted and stalled on the htc screen. Maybe a higher class sd card?

 - November 3, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2.1&&&Best App Ever&&&Running on my HTC Sensation. Without a doubt the best app I have ever purchased. I had a few problems but with the developers help I was able to get all issues resolved. It's great to be able to test new ROMs without having to redo all my settings again.  Word of advice to anyone, stay away from Superuser 3.x.x. Not that Superuser is bad in anyway, it just doesn't play nice with this app.  Hope they will add support for tablets, this app would rock on my G-Tablet.

I had a few issues at the start but the developers responded to my question very quickly and within a few hours we had it figured out.  Great for people who love to try ROMs but get tired of rebuilding all of their settings/apps.
 - October 5, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2.1&&&Working well on Desire HD&&&Couldn't get it to work initially, but after emailing my log file to support, the problem (a dodgy install) was quickly identified and is now working like a charm. Great app and great support. Thanks

 - October 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 2.2.1&&&Awesome App Awesome Dev Team&&&I am using Droid X.  Initially only 2nd-Init roms worked for me in any rom slots.  I emailed the Dev's support and they got back to me within the hour to help me solve my problem.

Could EASILY charge 10$ for this app (and maybe give a free trial) and I would have still bought it! Sure not ALL ROMs work, but a hell of a lot of them do! Also they reply quite quickly to emails (within a day every time easily) and their forums are monitored by extremely competent and knowledgeable users/devs. Overall just incredible and I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone! If you're on the fence, go for it!

 - January 5, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 2.1&&&Love the idea....&&&but, both times I've tried this app, I had to restore a nandroid from recovery because after I installed a ROM to a slot it would never boot, just stay on the splash screen. There doesn't seem to be a way to get back to the "phone ROM" once you've tried to boot from a slot unsuccessfully. Once something goes wrong with the slot ROM during the initial boot, you're SOL. Hopefully if you're using this app, you're already smart enough to have a nandroid to fall back on.

Have so far only been able to install as ext2. Only tried installing MIUI and Deck's 1.3d. So far so good. App seems to have some licensing issues caused by DRM. After rebooting into a rom after initial installation, I need to be signed into a registered google account before the app recognizes it is a legit version. Drop the DRM guys!
 - August 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3&&&Love it&&&This is the best app to come around in a long time. Right now flawlessly quadruple booting synergy, salvagemod, salvage sense and miui. Great job!!!
 - August 25, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3&&&Took me a minute&&&But I finally got this up and running. And I am eternally grateful to init2winit, this is just what I was looking for. Tip to any Thunderbolt users: use the ext4 file system.
 - August 29, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3&&&Great idea and customer support&&&I had some problems at first, but the devs helped me work thru things (via email people) and I now have it running smoothly.

 - August 29, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 1.3&&&Confused&&&How do you install gapps for cm roms
 - August 21, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3&&&Excellent&&&Now all I need is a faster sd!
 - April 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3&&&Epicness Incarnate&&&I love this app. I love everything about it. This is the only app I have found yet to be worth actually purchasing!
 - August 24, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3&&&Thunder-Flash&&&Works great on Thunderbolt.
 - August 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3&&&Awesome&&&Can't wait until they release it for the Nexus
 - July 31, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.3&&&Working on getting it working...&&&Although it has yet to work on my DINC, I have received more than the required assistance from the debate and can't wait to get it working :)
 - August 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3&&&Just what ive been wishing for&&&
 - August 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.2&&&Must have&&&Very cool now with the fixes no more nand restore and update.zip flashing. Big potential keep it up guys
 - August 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.2&&&Most Excellent&&&Excellent, must have app for frequent flashers. Works great, except Sense in rom slots on emmc lag. Great support from revs. DINC.
 - August 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.2&&&Excellent!&&&HTC Thunderbolt- I am very satisfied with this program. Not perfect, but getting closer. I will send my suggestions/bugs to your web page for review.
 - August 12, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 1.2&&&Broken on the Nexus One&&&I get the 'unable to load Boot.img' or whatever when trying to switch back to the phone ROM.
 - August 20, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2&&&Good idea. Takes patience&&&At first I had nothing but problems with this app and the devs (since they didn't return my email). But, that is all behind me. I have been successful in flashing MIUI and CM7 as SD Roms on my EVO4G running MikG 2.42. They run smooth, but take a lot of SD Card space. Def suggest 16 or 32 GB card. Class 6 or Higher for Sense Roms. Best suggestions ... follow the directions. Ensure you know about the ROM you're flashing, before you do. And have patience, this takes time to complete.
 - August 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.2&&&Fantastic!&&&Absolutely incredible. Takes a while to install the roms into a slot, but after that, quick switching between multiple roms. Thunderbolt
 - August 19, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.2&&&Rick&&&Love the program.will give it 5 stars when they iron out a few more bugs.getting boot.img failed to flash on thunderbolt
 - August 18, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.2&&&Good concept still buggy&&&Sadly the room installed well but the apps that came with my room installed in slot one, appeared on my phone rom when I booted into it,
 - August 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 1.2&&&Some things not working right but devs are working on this. Other than that ...&&&Some things not working right but devs are working on this. Other than that great app, keep up the good work devs.
