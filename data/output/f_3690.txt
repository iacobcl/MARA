 - June 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 6.1.1.138&&&Solid app&&&A very good app for syncing with Outlook.  Developer has significantly improved calendar performance with the latest update.
 - June 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 6.1.1.138&&&Getting there!&&&Probably the best outlook syncer out there. Nice improvements lately. I still want the time popup for setting up new events to be improved. Stable, new calendar views are neat.  Would look at the old palms and emulate their interface. I need to be able to set a password for an individual note (notes of my internet passwords).
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 6.1.1.138&&&Version 6 is rock!&&&The new calendar UI looks pro and very  fast.
 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 6.1.1.138&&&No cloud required!&&&Thank goodness someone has created a sound piece of software to sync locally with Outlook via Bluetooth. Excellent job.
 - May 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1.1.122&&&Better than its competitor but ...&&&To keep your private contacts info to yourself, VCO is more reliable than dejaoffice/companionlink. Warning: don't edit an item on both handset and PC - just do one OR the other. Reason: conflicts like this are not merged or synced. They're ignored, so VCO will appear to have failed to sync. This is by design. I do with they'd make this optional (default off) to sync anyway even if it makes a duplicate.
 - May 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 5.1.1.122&&&Still a mess on Version 5&&&Later versions (5.x) are awful.  It dropped contacts on sync, inserted email addresses from a group of contacts into other contacts erroneously, etc.  Thank heaven Outlook is still intact.  I will have to manually fix dozens of contacts.  Tech support does send instant email acknowledgment but doesn't really answer questions for 2-3 days.  Don't waste your money.
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1.1.122&&&Good improvement in v6&&&Good app, the best in its kind. Recurring events synchro is not yet perfect but support is great and they should fix it soon
 - May 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 5.1.1.122&&&Pretty good&&&A few little annoyances but in general.a great app. Use with HTC & outlook express.
 - May 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Neo &&& 5.1.1.122&&&Excellant support & Outlook sync&&&Been using VCO for some time now. Appreciate its full interface with Outlook, and what was a clunky look is now getting better with the latest release. Any email queries are answered within the day, and for me the latest update went fine, but you must update the PC as well and then sync to complete the update - something they don't make clear. Update May 2012. Transfer of data seems to have speeded up. Just need to increase fontsize in calanders and it will be heading to a 5.
 - April 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 5.1.1.122&&&Excellent app and excellent support!!!!&&&
 - April 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Sensation XL &&& 5.1.1.122&&&Sync still extremely slow&&&Even after installing latest update the sync takes ages....indeed it copies and does not synchronize both ways according to the newest entry in notes e.g.  Just got newer note overwritten by older, will uninstall the app.
 - March 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 4G &&& 5.1.1.119&&&Sync takes forever&&&It copies and re-writes every single item from / to Outlook every time; so depending on how much information you store, it could take over an hour to sync. It is really slow. Calendar events created on the phone take about 2 minutes each to be copied to Outlook. When it syncs, it doesn't delete items you have deleted on either device; so it's not really syncing, it's just copying. Sometimes deletes items that wasn't supposed to.  I think all the positive reviews come from the developer.
 - March 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 5.1.1.119&&&Best App to Sync with Outlook 2010&&&It appears that all of the bugs from the initial release of VCO5 have been fixed.  Syncing 1200 contacts and 260 calendar events only takes about 3 minutes or less over Wi-Fi (initial sync took 15 mins+-).  Support is excellent.  A must have!
 - March 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG myTouch E739 &&& 5.1.1.116&&&Good App...I installed the lite version...worked great...had to uninstall lite ...&&&Good App...I installed the lite version...worked great...had to uninstall lite to start pro...with the lite I was able to sync via Bluetooth, but i.was displeased after purchasing the pro to find out that I had to purchase another program to.sync using Bluetooth. That was a rip off. I do like the app.	Good app...
 - March 21, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1.1.116&&&Struggled with the program for almost a year, finally uninstalled it today. ...&&&Struggled with the program for almost a year, finally uninstalled it today. duplicates, deleting stuff by itself, etc. don't trust your data to it.
March 18, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 5.1.1.116&&&VCO Pro Sync Center Version 5&&&Some tasks do not appear on the Calendar. They exist only in  Tasks. Not a perfect app. Can require hours of fixing duplicates. Works better syncing phone to Outlook, then bidirectional to avoid duplicates.
 - March 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1.1.116&&&Great....at times&&&Been using this for over a year. I love being able to sync everything and quick support responses. Unfortunately each version has too many bugs and I am realizing that this is a lot more work and stress than it should be. There has to be a better option out there!
 - March 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 5.1.1.116&&&Love it&&&Thanks for the new release. Well done!!!
 - March 21, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 5.1.1.116&&&Still inconsistent...&&&I've been using this for about 6 months.  I've gone through 2 or 3 updates.  Bought everything, including the bluetooth module.  Automatic sync has never worked.  It stops after a few days either using Bluetooth or WiFi.  New contacts in Outlook don't always make it over to the phone, necessitating a 20 minute manual sync.  Developer needs to hire more software test staff, IMHO.
 - February 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 5.1.1.108&&&The best Outlook sync on Android&&&I've been using this for months now to sync my contacts, calendar, tasks and notes between Outlook and my HTC Sensation. In VCOrganizer everything is handled fine (apart from yearly recurring events in tinezones with daylight savings, which they are working on). You can also sync to the native contacts and calendar.  If you plan to use this I recommend a clear phone contacts and calendar beforehand. With some phones you need to edit the contact in the native product before you can link it to another contact
 - February 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 5.1.1.108&&&Outstanding but weak new release!&&&Latest release adds some missing functionalities which makes this app a perfect partner for outlook and businessman. But it has been released too early without a proper and effective beta testing.  Waiting for new fixing updates.
 - March 22, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1.1.108&&&Sucks on a Samsung Galaxy&&&Worked ok at first, but after the upgrade the contacts refused to connect to my phone, or showed duplicates, and did not show addresses. Worse, it synched my random Google contacts back into my outlook! I finally gave up and purged everything, cleaned up outlook, exported into Google, and   synched Google. I will have to do this every week. But the calender works fine so I only synch that. two stars for that!
 - February 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 5.1.1.108&&&Caution!!!&&&It's an "ok" app. The fonts are very small and there is no adjustment available. There are no settings that allow for color  customization. In the Week View, the vertical and horizontal lines are virtually invisible making it a real struggle to see the date and times easily. This is a mobile device and it should be note user friendly to use on the go. It has Greater duplicates in BOTH calendar and contacts, requiring me to purchase another program to correct the mistakes created by this program.  Caution!!!
March 5, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1.1.108&&&Jumbled mess!&&&I truly loathe the day I purchased this app. It has made an unrepairable mess of my calendar. I can't even fix it through Outlook-it is such a mess. New updates buggy too. Ugh!
 - March 17, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 5.1.1.108&&&Not quite ready for prime time&&&Lots of good features that just don't quite work correctly.  Also, you better be a computer geek, because the "documentation" doesn't give you much help.  Be careful!   The first sync caused a "corrupted Outlook data file" which the Exchange server, at the office, would not accept.  The Microsoft repair utility, SCANPST.EXE, could not fix it. My backup file would not replace the lost entries in the copy that is kept on the server.  Result was I had to start from scratch and re-enter ALL contacts and calendar entries, manually.  Even then, it still doesn't handle recurring events correctly (e.g. birthdays, holidays and etc.).  It looks like a time zone problem.  One-day events run from 4:00 AM on one day to 4:00 AM on the next, instead of midnight to midnight.  So they show as two days. The Contacts section does not pass phone number dialing strings correctly to my HTC Thunderbolt.  If there is a "w" in the dialing string (used when entering extension numbers into voice mail systems) it brings up the "Send" dialog box with a blank dialing string.  So, it never dials the rest of the digits. All in all, VCOrganizer Pro is not a Pro.  A rank amatuer, at best.  Not worth the price tag.
 - February 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1.1.108&&&No refund!!&&&Product does not sync properly! Too bad. Loved it at first. Now erasing and duplicating. No refund after request.
 - March 8, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 5.1.1.108&&&Updates Horrible&&&Tried several ways to sync w outlook and this was the only way - including notes. Latest updates suck on HTC Thunderbolt. Slow, crashes.
 - February 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 5.1.1.108&&&Keeps me on time!&&&
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 5.1.1.105&&&Excellent app - responsive developers&&&Have been happy with version 4. Had some issues when upgrading to 5, but developers were very responsive via email and fixed the force closure issue. Once again I am a satisfied user of VCO PRO.
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 5.1.1.105&&&Perfect&&&Recent updates make this the hands down best solution for syncing w/ MS Outlook. I've tried them all; this one takes the prize.
 - February 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 5.1.1.105&&&Best Option to Sync with Outlook&&&* * UPDATE* * : Just upgraded to v.5.1.1.105 and it went off without a hitch. No problems with duplicate contacts or recurring events ( I have a lot ), like some people have mentioned. Helped to read instructions PRIOR to upgrade. New SmartLinks are a great additional new feature. . . * * ORIGINAL REVIEW * * :I looked at several options to sync with Outlook (CompanionLink, Missing Link, Android Sync Manager) and did NOT want to use the "cloud" - this is by far the best option on the market. Had some minor issues and the developer(s) were very responsive & helpful.I now seamlessly and confidently sync contacts, calendar, notes & tasks.
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1.1.105&&&Great app&&&I used a few other apps like this but this is by far the best. Works great with MS Outlook 2010.
 - February 12, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1.1.105&&&Recent upgrade no good&&&Recent upgrade has messed up all my all-day events (all all-day event boxes unchecked). Tech-support responsive  but not useful. I have to manually rectify hundreds of all-day events. I will think twice before using its next upgrade.
 - February 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 5.1.1.102&&&Version 5.0 on my infuse 4g&&&still looks great, loved that there was a copy paste function added on a previous update . . . but now, since version 5 update, it no longer syncs with my android contacts.  I've tried every thing I could think of, syncing with mobile, deleting everything and starting over, but it doesn't sync with my native android contact book.  Also needs a ringtone feature.
 - February 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 5.1.1.102&&&very good support&&&works well with htc wildfire. support from developer is helpful and issue with latest release was fixed quickly.
 - January 31, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1.1.102&&&Don't Update To v.5&&&I wish I hadn't updated. Version 4 was a daily life saver for me. Version 5 is a mess that is successful in giving me "force close" issues only. It will be a long time before I spend this kind of money on an app.
 - February 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1.1.102&&&The only choice for Outlook Sync via USB&&&This app is the only calendar app that syncs with Outlook via USB correctly. I've tried all the the other options, and none of them work, duplicating data, deleting data behind. I had a few difficulties with the upgrade to V5, but only minor, and recent updates have resolved any difficulties I've had.
 - January 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 5.1.1.100&&&:(&&&Was really good but latest upgrade has made it virtually unusable. Calendar hangs. Sync messed up records. Really hoping you guys get this sorted fast (Samsung galaxy tab)

 - January 31, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 5.1.1.98&&&Upgrade to 5 does not work&&&Version 4 is a great product and works as advertised. I’d give it 5 stars *****. I relied on this product daily.  Version 5 is full of bugs.  Support only available through email and is listed at three days.  Not cool. I wish there was a way to go back to version 4. Sometimes a free upgrade is very costly.  Now I need to find and purchase an alternate application that has less functionality. I have wasted hours trying to get this to work properly.  Another update came out today.  Looks like Vecal is trying to fix this.  More testing would have eliminated hours of frustration.
 - January 29, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 5.1.1.98&&&Latest release has some bugs&&&It's a very good application and sincronizes fine. But latest release (yesterday) has some minor bugs and created duplicates on contacts. Last release destroyed the good application it was :( I losed many contacts, calendar is slow and buggy :( Pity
 - January 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 5.1.1.98&&&Getting Better&&&Upgrades appearing go help.
 - January 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 5.1.1.91&&&Force close - locks up After Update&&&Worked great before update. After update I get force close errors - or it just freezes - or both. A huge thumbs down until this is fixed. Incredible.

Never had an issue after updating but now I cannot open any calendar  appointment to look at the details of the appointment. When pushing on an appointment to look at the details of the appointment I am taking back to the previous weeks view of appointments! Help!

 - December 6, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.1.1.50&&&Nice to find an app that delivers what it promises&&&Tried 4 other apps attempting to sync Outlook. Most worked only occasionally, if at all. Bought VCOrganizer Pro. It has worked flawlessly from Day 1, Wish everything else on my phone worked as well.

 - May 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 4.1.1.50&&&Best app to sync with Outlook&&&Works well with outlook, sync's well and trouble free. The only complaint I have is poor notification when they update SyncCenter
January 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Incredible S &&& 4.1.1.50&&&Very Prfessional&&&After trying Deja Office/Companion Link and spending a small fortune for the priviledge, this program is a real treat to use and everything works well.  Only one hitch found: After Deleting a Category in Outlook it still shows up in VCO Pro. Would appreciate option: Remove Deleted Category from Mobile, check box in Sync Centre/Sync History/Categories. similar to what is available in the Contacts tab.
 - October 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.1.1.50&&&Does the job well; a couple of cautions.&&&Changing from an older Blackberry to Samsung-SGH-1997.  Needed a way to import my data from Outlook since the SIM was changed and Best Buy were not very helpful.  Syncs Notes, Tasks, Contacts flawlessly like RIM desktop software.  Tried to sync my entire Outlook calendar but runs for hours.  Going to the shorter timescale of -1 to +3 months, it accomplishes a total sync in 60sec.  Note: changes to Android Calendar not sync'd; but VCO syncs to Android.  Note: Contacts with a name but no data are not syncd.
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.1.1.50&&&Works great!&&&This is the only app I found to sync everything and do it easy. The only thing I found wrong is the duplicate and triple contacts. There needs to be a way to purge the contacts in VCOrganizer so you can re-sync and get rid of all the duplicate and triple contacts.
 - May 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.1.1.50&&&Fantastic syncing tool with Outlook&&&I have tried a number of apps but this one is actually accurate and works with my HTC Desire HD and Windows 7. So far no issues and really pleased!!! Many Thanks

 - May 6, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 4.1.1.50&&&Great App and great support&&&After changing from Windows Mobile 6.5 phone, I was looking for a solution to sync all of my Outlook stuff (Contacts, Calendar, Notes and Tasks) with my new Atrix. I tried another product before trying VCOrganizer Pro. This product meets and in some cases exceeds what I was needing. I’ve made some suggestions to Vecal on enhancements that I would like to see. Customer Service has been especially responsive and very receptive to user suggestions. Double Thumbs Up!!!!
 - July 16, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.1.1.50&&&VC Organizer Pro&&&After paying for all of the Checkmark products from Greenbeansoft, installing them, trying to get them to work, communicating with Greenbeansoft only to have them provide excuses instead of support, the VCOrganizer Pro is a ray of sunshine. I installed it, configured it and it worked the first time exactly as advertised. It can sync via tether or Wi-Fi and contains its own security system. I don't know how tech support is because I have never needed them. I think that says it all. Thank you VeCal
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 4.1.1.50&&&Very good app&&&Very good app to sync with outlook.  I've tried the others, and this one performed with the least complication. No missing / corrupted contacts (I have around 1500), no dupes. Good for GTDr's who like to use tasks.  Good use of categories  I had an issue, and tech support was very responsive. (Turns out it was a problem with my outlook installation and they gave recommendations on how to fix it ).  Would give 4+/5- stars if i could because GUI feels a little primative. Otherwise 5 stars all the way around.
 - November 18, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 4.1.1.50&&&Can't get it to auto sync-slow to no support&&&Was real excited about this one. Wont autosync unless I disable eSet firewall. Even with no firewall contacts don't update. Motorola Photon 4g.
 - July 21, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.1.1.50&&&The Missing Link!&&&Like everone else here I need outlook notes and tasks to sync with my android phone. The app worked perfectly, first time for me. In my opinion one of the best solutions on the market at the moment. The widgets look good too.
 - June 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.1.1.50&&&Works perfectly&&&This app does exactly what it says, which is sync perfectly with Outlook. Got great support from Vecal when I ordered the wrong version and had to ask for a refund. They did so promptly so I could then order the Pro version.
 - January 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.1.1.50&&&Working well&&&Overall works very well. Sometimes tasks don't quite synch properly, and there's the odd spelling error, otherwise fine
 - July 25, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.1.1.50&&&Five Stars because...&&&This program works very well if you know what you're doing. Be careful with the SyncCenter setup. Initially to start I setup the sync from Outlook to Mobile (one way only). Also... I did experience duplicates with some Contacts & Calendar entries. My solution (which worked a trick!), was to reset/wipeout all of the VCO data. I also (deliberately) deleted all of the other Android databases. Did a fresh VCO sync (one way) Outlook to mobile, and it was all perfect! Now I can sync bidirectionally with no issues

 - March 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 4.1.1.50&&&You Have To Have It!&&&I got my new Droid X and immediately began the search and trial of PIM programs that sync directly with Outlook in a local configuration only. I tried them all. Don't hesitate buying since there is not trial, just buy it and get productive from the first minute. I have synced wireless over two different networks and now go direct with the add-on bluetooth option (get that too). I have not had an issue with it keeping the Android contacts updated with their contacts db as I did with most all the rest.BUYIT

Then another problem developed -- sometimes it would not recognize my Droid and be unable to sync. Final problem is that the app only removes deleted appointments around half the time. I contacted tech service about these. You can only reach them via e-mail. At the start they were very engaged and helpful, but never solved any of the three problems, and now they are not responding to emails. Better than nothing, but...

 - September 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 4.1.1.46&&&The best Outlook Sync App!&&&I have a Moto Photon, and I've tried MyPhonExplorer, Android-sync, and HTC's sync app. They all had significant limitations. VCOrganizer Pro,on the other hand, syncs everything you could want to, does it easily, and throws in some great Apps and widgets to boot. Their calendar widget rocks, and their contacts app is now what I use by default. It's the best PIM app I've ever used! You will get what you pay for with the free apps. VCO is worth way more than its price - it saves a lot of frustration.
 - September 8, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 4.1.1.46&&&Most Amazing Outlook Sync App for Android&&&VSOrganizer Pro is an amazing product. I have HTC Desire S and needed to sync with Win 7. I tried several other sync apps with disappointing and frustrating results. VSOrganiser Pro simply works like a breeze. Setup is easy, it syncs all fields in contacts including alpha characters in phone no fields. It syncs calendar, tasks and notes beautifully well. Screen Layouts, navigation and search are intuitive and Superb.Worth every cent. People, don't waste time with other duds out there. Just go for this.
