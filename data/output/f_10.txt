 - April 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.7&&&Love the ever-changing fish&&&Beautiful and fun app. The surprise fish that changes is great. I would love to have the sea turtle as a choice.
 - May 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 2.7&&&The Best Out There&&&I've tried many other live wallpapers since purchasing this but I always end up coming back to this. It's just too well done! No scamming looping video, customizable sea life, not overly demanding on resources, animation and design just right. This is how live wallpapers should be!  I'm still looking forward to anything that can top this in my books though!
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 2.7&&&Wow Beautiful!&&&Great app! Lock screen especially is beautiful. Only thing stopping me from giving this app 5 stars is the absence of a Sperm Whale.
 - March 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.7&&&Very relaxing wallpaper&&&In a world with so much chaos and rushing about, it is soothing and relaxing to have your very own personal aquarium to relax your mind and soothe away any tensions.  Love it!!
 - June 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.7&&&Looks great&&&The variety of everything is brilliant. So many cool fish and backgrounds. I just wish the screen responded when the touched it rather than the fish just swimming quicker. Small thing
 - March 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.7&&&Very realistic&&&This is so good my cat actually stares at my tablet and moves his head along with the fish.  I like the app, has lot's of choices and great look.  Works on my Motorola xyboard 64 and Motorola droid 4
 - May 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.7&&&John&&&Very realistic but needs a coral beauty to complete it and maybe making the clown fish move in the anemones but all in all 5 STARS!!!
 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 2.7&&&Awesome&&&Very best lap. Please keep adding more fish!

 - April 19, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.7&&&Jonathan&&&Installed on my Verizon Droid Razor. If I go to setup after install, it locks up my home screen. It takes about 45 seconds to unfreeze my phone. At that point the aquarium is not running. If I install and let it be, it runs fine. I can make adjustment in the options.
 - June 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.7&&&Awesome&&&I've tried many live wallpapers and I LOVE this one.  Operates smoothly, no ads popping up all day, and it's realistic action is fun to watch.  The full version has lots of cool options too.
 - June 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 2.7&&&Love it !!&&&Its an awesome lwp,n it looks so realistic. I love how you can add whatever fish you want. However it would be better if you could feed the fish ... But still an awesome app :)
 - March 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 2.7&&&Awesome!&&&My favorite live wallpaper!  But since last update with new background, wallpaper screen has been freezing for about 5 seconds several times a minute; resumes on its own. Bionic
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.7&&&Les C&&&Brilliant app, graphics is great, choice of aquarium life is great, choice of backgrounds brilliant and love the tap to feed, i think the shark is a bit tiny compared to the other fish but otherwise looks stunning on my Galaxy S2. Works flawlessly too.
 - March 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 2.7&&&I love it!&&&I've got the Koi app on my tablet and now this gorgeous aquarium on my phone. Please keep designing wallpapers.
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 2.7&&&ATM&&&Whooo! I bet the guys from "Tanked" have THIS on their phones!
 - March 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.7&&&I love the background available&&&,so I don't need to change from the gallery. I wish there are more options for fishes to choose from. The jellyfish is disappointing because I see incredibly beautiful ones on internet. Better value.

 - June 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 2.7&&&Just fun&&&Cool live wallpaper... Not really good for anything other than entertainment & 0.99 cents is cheaper than most gumballs and this wallpaper is more fun!

 - March 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.7&&&Great live wall paper, looks beautiful.&&&Tried out the free version and loved it, so I got the paid one and the settings make it even better.  The new Sunken ship background is great (goes well with the treasure chest toy), and the variety of fish is great (sharks, jellyfish, sea horses, and turtles, among many regular fish).  Originally got it for my OG Droid, and it looks even better on my Galaxy Nexus screen!
 - May 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.7&&&Love it&&&Though it would be fun if you had holiday fish. A skeleton fish, or a santa fish. Something fun.
 - May 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 2.7&&&Best aquarium wallpaper!&&&Definitely deserves "5 Stars"!
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 2.7&&&Mesmerizingly cool!&&&I've tried lots of live wallpaper apps and downloaded a few. I first dwld the Free version. Watching the video of additional features when purchased was helpful in deciding if I wanted it. This is the ONLY live wallpaper app I ever felt worth the money to try and I'm completely delighted!  The colors and animation are amazingly real! The various settings to customize it make it look so real!  It's like having my own personal, portable aquarium!  Truly a GREAT JOB!!
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 2.7&&&Fishiiies&&&I like this wallpaper i purchased full version today so we shall see how well it holds...i had previously purchased the kittehface koi wallpaper its running great and its looovely highly recommend it. Only 2 suggestions make it more natural moving...put in the startle feature.

 - March 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 2.7&&&Underwater Bliss&&&For $1 how do you beat this?  Doesn't lock up, fish don't die, only restriction is the number of fish you can fit in the tank.  All different kinds of fish, my tank has seahorse, jelly fish, shark, sea turtle, and a dozen fish I don't even know the names of.  There's always room for improvement, but only suggest here would be keep adding backgrounds and fish! (How did Dylan get an eel??) Motorola Droid 3.
 - May 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.7&&&6 stars&&&This is the BEST live wallpaper I've ever bought. Endless options for customization!!
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.7&&&Beautiful & Colorful&&&Reallu like it.  I try others and always come back to my fishys. Thanks
 - March 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Dart &&& 2.7&&&Bug Report but 5 Star app&&&1st of all, this has to be the besty $0.99 that I have ever spent... but I do have 1 problem to report: Everytime I do a restart/reboot of the phone, the wallpaper reverts to the phones default, which is really annoying :'(  Other than the 1 problem, it's definately a 5 Star app and Very Realistic visually ;~)   I would know..  I am aka TheReefGuy from the late '80s to mid '90s
 - May 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 2.7&&&I love it!&&&I've had this app since I've had my phone. I don't think I'll ever change my wallpaper ever.  I saved the fish tank in a scene so that if my phone shuts off I don't have to always reset the tank. When I power off my phone though it saves my tank when I turn it back on.
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.7&&&Just extended the enjoyment of my phone 10x!&&&Beautiful assortment of fish, backgrounds, & props. So happy they included a sea turtle. As the title said this live wallpaper is awesome, beautiful and makes me look forward to looking at my phone instead of just running any particular task. Works great on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus. Great job and at a $1 it's a steal. Love it!
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.7&&&Well worth the $&&&I had the free version first then  I bought this one. Worth the .99 usd. Very beautiful. Lots of customization options. You can even load your own background. It's soothing to look at and make new setups. Some of the fish are more artificial looking then the others. Scale is a little off, artifacts around edges, and jerky animation. However most of the rendering is great. I love the movement of the plants. Great props and toys as well.
 - April 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Huawei IDEOS &&& 2.7&&&Beautiful & affordable&&&Very pretty & hypnotic, I luv watching it. it's one of my fave wallpapers. I tried the free version & immediately got the paid version after seeing how awesome the "aquariums" were& I'm very happy w/my purchase. btw; they definitely could charge more due 2 the quality of the app, but are totally awesome 4 only charging $.99...how cool is that?!?!

 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.66&&&Only live wallpaper aquarium worth looking at&&&It seems Kittehface has the market cornered on these type of things.  Beautiful fish, lots of plant, prop, and background options.  This is the fish lwp you want  The only quibble I have is the sharks are just too small and there's only one kind and size.  If there were properly scaled sharks  of the same quality as the fish I'd be ecstatic.

Keeps the cat entertained and is relaxing for me to watch. I sense that it may be making things a bit laggy if tablet is used for any other purpose, so will test more and if this is correct I will use it as required for my amusement, not as a permanent wallpaper. BTW how do you uninstall the free version?
 - January 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 2.66&&&Beautiful reliable & easy to configure&&&Like all the other wonderful Kittehface wallpapers this one doesn't cause problems, is amazingly detailed, and easy to use. Thank you!

All other aquariums have 2D fish that just swim from one end of the screen to the other screen and never turn around.

Stop your reading & download it NOW. No regrets.
