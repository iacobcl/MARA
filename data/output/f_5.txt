 - March 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great for great phones&&&I love everything about this. Really helps customize my phone to make it really look the way I want, and make my iPhone friends jealous! However, I have a lower-end device and this will often crash. Still worth it to me though.
 - March 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best so far!&&&Best launcher.. I've tried all the popular ones.. taking my cue from droid forums and tech magazines. ADW Ex was not the top choice but i found out otherwise. The best choice for all you mods and customization freaks just like me ha ha.
 - December 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Love it!&&&I have been using ADW.Launcher now for almost a year on my old tablet.  When I bought my new tablet, Toshiba AT100 (Thrive in the US), I bought the EX version, and I am kicking myself for not purchasing it earlier.  The expanded customization options have allowed me to truly make this tablet my own.  I strongly recommend this app.
 - December 16, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Regarding update:&&&Update has brought some good new features, but why get rid of the old hidden dock bar?? One of my favourite features on ADW. Please fix.
 - January 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Admire &&& 1.3.3.56&&&The best&&&It's the only home replacement app that's not super laggy on 2.3 Android I figured every replacement would run smother on it but some of them work better on 2.1 that's just weird adw has the best themes anyways so I don't mind at all. I've always liked adw launcher anyway
 - January 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome!&&&Works a treat on my low spec galaxy phone and out performs the other launchers by a long shot - top notch app.
 - February 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Fantastic Launcher&&&This launcher has Launcher Pro beat! Tried them both and love this one. So much easier to use and works perfectly! Thanks devs.... Samsung Galaxy 2
 - January 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent replacement for HTC Sense&&&Sense in HTC Inspire was a pure crap. Used to crash at least twice a day, requiring a battery pull. ADW has been awesome, out of my way, very fast, makes you forget it is there and gives a better battery life.
 - December 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&:)!&&&Fantastic, but... All this needs is the ability to hide apps in the app drawer :), AND I DONT THINK THE OPENING TRADITIONS WORK (no meanness intended)
 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Tried them all. Keep coming back.&&&This launcher is the most stable, smooth and customisable one out there (Doesn't require internet access permissions like most, no privacy leaks). I just wish the dev would continue to refine this already adequate app. It's a shame to neglect an app best in it's category! ):
 - January 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Never failed me so far.&&&Fully customizable, light on resources, works perfectly on Huawei Ideos (U8150) and Ideos X5 (U8800).
 - March 31, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Tablet&&&Although it is much faster than the stock honeycomb launcher, it doesn't switch orientation as tidily. Eg I can't get some widgets into their correct size no matter what grid configuration I use. Would give 5 stars for better 16:9 screen support.
 - February 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Dare I say, better than Go?&&&I've used Go Launcher for quite some time now. It's got lots of features and is highly customizable, but lately it has become sluggish.   So I decided to give ADW another shot. Wow! I am very impressed with it's speed. Plus it has a graft deal of customizability as well. I'll stick with ADW from now on. Good job, dev.
 - February 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&New update works well on ICS, but...&&&Great stuff, after the most recent update almost everything is working flawlessly! However, on my new Galaxy Nexus, the dock bar occasionally goes dead/less sensitive and I have to restart the launcher to avoid mashing the buttons several times.  This doesn't happen on the stock ICS launcher or any modified versions of the stock launcher.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent&&&I'm not sure I could be happier, especially since I got it during the 10 cent deals.  So much better than the default launcher on Asus Transformer.  Organization is very helpful and animations are slick.  Nice job Anderweb!
 - February 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome&&&New folders great,5 star from me again. Those saying you cant edit in dock no more,try reading changelog! double tap.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent update, working flawlessly.&&&Runs very smooth with Ice Cream Sandwich roms - ZERO lag or redraws here. Love the new config options. Nexus S 4G, ICS 4.0.3 rom
 - December 23, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Landscape for Gingerbread blows!&&&I really like this.  I just don't understand why the dock will only sit at the bottom of the screen in landscape mode for Honeycomb and up.. Why not for Gingerbread? There REALLY should be a setting in there so we can choose.  I don't think Honeycomb or ICS users can choose to NOT have it at the bottom of the screen.. I would be interested in knowing if this problem is due to some type of OS constraint, hardware issue or just a bad decision... As it is I lose dock icons in landscape. 5 stars if it's fixed.
March 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Finaly a launcher pro rival!&&&Wow!  Have been a launcher pro user for some time now and have tried countless other launchers ...but this once i got the theme i wanted have been able to customize to my hearts content!  Have been able to make it near perfect ,it works very smoothly and quickly ...only problem is the play shop widget doesnt seem to come out right, as in it looks like its missing parts of its picture but tbh i dont think its the app and more the widget itself lol ..overall v impressed by this launcher !!! Motorola atrix ...
 - May 31, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&The Good and Not So Good&&&I've been using GoLauncher EX for a long time. Switched recently to ADW EX and here are my thoughts:   Speed, transition effects, customizations: ADW EX wins hands down, more options, smoother animations and great dock customization.   F/Cs: I had no issues with F/Cs using either launcher on my old Samsung Galaxy and on my new Droid.   App Drawer: Gotta give it to GoLauncher EX here. The ability to add folders to the app drawer does NOT exist in ADW. Also, with GoLauncher you can sort apps by All/Recent/Running. Sorting by runnign allows you to terminate apps that are sucking resources, and sorting by Recent allows you to clean history of recently used apps. <THIS FEATURE IS SORELY MISSED! It would be great if ADW would add this.   Themes: Both launchers offer some really great themes. I prefer ADW simply because of the extra icons available with many of the themes.   Overall a GREAT launcher, I'm very happy!
 - May 12, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Sensation 4g&&&Love this app but drains my battery to  quickly,  i hardly use my phone and drains to quick please fix removing intil then my battery doesnt last 3 hrs with out going in yellow this is me not using the phone, also since downloading it my brightness setting has been changing to full brightness by itself
 - April 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Amazing&&&This is pretty cool. I was worried about switching back to stock (no option) but if you are rooted, just "freeze it" in Titanium Backup, and wala, you have your stock back and can defrost it to switch back and forth. Great app, well worth the money!
 - January 7, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&random restarts&&&I'm experiencing random restarts of my device (Huawei MediaPad) when using ADWLauncher EX, it's happening mostly when the device is going to sleep, when I try to wake it up, I realize it's turned off.. sometimes there's "enter PIN" screen which indicates self-restart.. I purchased it 24 hours ago and I experienced more than 10 self-restarts of my device.. if the ADW launcher is installed, but not running, everything is fine.. I wrote an email to the developer, let's see this issue can be resolved  oh, I was hoping to hold on Rating until this issue is resolved, but I can't write a review without the rating.. and I just realized the review on the bottom of this page by Jimmy on December 13, 2011, who's experiencing the same restarts with his device.. that's very dissapointing.. I'm rating with 3 stars than and I'll come back later with new rating depends on the reaction and possible solution from developer
 - January 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&WOW!&&&I don't know what to say, there are so many customizations I could get lost.  This is my first customizable launcher so I'm still learning, but so far I love it. Added bonus, when I bought this launcher I didn't realize I would be able to download TONS of other themes and icon packs for FREE. It is so worth the few bucks I paid to be able to use this on my Galaxy S, Asus Transformer and Lenovo IdeaPad K1.
 - January 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Perfection&&&One of the best and most polished apps I use, always one of the first apps I download SGS2
 - March 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent!&&&Takes time to setup properly but absolutely worth it! I decided to try ADW after (getting the impression - I might be wrong) that GO Launcher did not support my existing widgets. The free version (of ADW) was not working for me so I tried the paid version in the hope that it might get more attention from the developer. It certainly does. It has a couple of minor bugs but is otherwise a massive improvement over the default ICS Launcher. Thanks!
 - January 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Needs an upgrade&&&But not great. As adw has grown they've taken a few features out, and put a lot more in, which were sometimes confusing to get to. Requires lots of patience
 - December 18, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Disappointed.&&&I would of gave it 5 stars if the froyo dock,  icons and dots were included in this like the screenshots show. Huge disappointment.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Amazingly fast!&&&This is the fastest launcher I've seen so far! The only thing that needs to be added is the option to make folders inside the app drawer.
 - March 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&More Updates&&&This is the best launcher by far. The customization is amazing and always runs smooth and never force closes. Thr only thing that adw needs to do is update it more, it feels like they abondoned it because we havnt had an uldate in forever
 - April 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Nice,&&&It is s nice launcher, very customizable, it would be perfect except for two things. One. Lack of support (I have scanned the site and emailed dev w/o responses ...ever..so if something doesn't work..you're on your own). Two the dev's own launcher add-on to display # of unread emails or SMS doesn't work with ADW EX.very strange since it works with default touch wis launcher :-(
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best app I paid for&&&I have an HTC sensation with sense installed, I grew tired of the home loading screen. ( Google HTC sense loading screen) so I bought this. My phone feels ten times faster.  The filler organization blew me away. Why can't the big companies learn from this developer. I would give ten stars If I could. Great job . I don't want to root and this app makes me happy about my phone.
 - December 30, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Not so good.&&&The default TouchWiz of SGS2 is far smoother than this. Moreover the free GoLauncher is better than this. Need a lot of improvement.
 - December 12, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome app - needs some updating&&&Great launcher. Would be even better if you could have folders within the app drawer. Gets hard to find things when u have 100+ apps and widgets.
 - December 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Superior launcher&&&I have tried many many launchers and this is really the best in terms of usability and prompt updates. Please fix the notifier as it FC in GNex. Thanks much!
 - December 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Fast, smooth&&&Fast, smooth, and featureful on all my high and low-end devices. Worth the full price. Galaxy S CM7 and Huawei U8150 CM7.
 - December 16, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Great but...&&&it's great app . everything works perfect expect one thing.. i cannot create folders in the drawer.. and that's why i left this app i have hundrends of apps.. and if i don't organize it in the darwer it's impossible to find anything.. hopefully it will be creared.. :\
 - January 10, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good app, poor support.&&&I liked the free version enough to purchase this one at full price, and I do enjoy the enhancements, but there are features in the free version that are not in this one. When I emailed the developer to inquire, I never received a response. Disappointed.
 - December 29, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Still decent, but...&&&This app is still alright, but it's come downhill with the recent updates. The dev has removed features and at the same time caused some performance hits (apps launched from the dock take much longer than those launched from the home screen). Definitely needs some tweaks.
 - June 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great app but...&&&Can you please update the dock to a more CM7 looking and functioning dock? The dock is really hideous and if the top indicating bar were ICS that would be excellent. There's a bug with the wallpaper that inhibits it to work as stock launcher displays it. The primer reason picking this launcher is that you can use the hide label to make it look Clean so having the edit option and the wall paper chooser on the desktop instead of within the drawer is not up to date. Also it would be nice to have access to widgets from within the drawer.
 - February 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Does ICS spell the end of ADWex?&&&I have been a loyal user for some time, however I tried the newly released ICS update from Asus for my transformer. Whilst the build is buggy and I'm back to HC 3.2.1, I did like the way ICS integrates the apps drawer with the widgets view. Any plans to update ADWex to include or improve upon the new ICS launcher? I love the dock function of ADWex, but it will become a tougher choice between it and stoked ICS when faster, less buggy builds turn up in coming weeks. Hoping you plan to move ADWex into the world of ICS, and up the features! Thanks.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3.3.56&&&My favorite launcher&&&Of all the launcher replacements this is the best! And improvements are always coming! Learn the settings and you will have complete control.
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.3.3.56&&&More than expected&&&Bought this app during 10¢ sale. Very much satisfied with this. Menus/options are simple to go through. A reset option to go back to default makes it feel safer to mess around with options. My Samsung Charge even seems to scroll and work much smoother when going from screen to screen even with added transitions. Worth the buy.
 - January 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&The best thing to hit my tablet screen.&&&For the price i payed for this quality piece of software, i almost feel guilty. Really good launcher an works great of galaxy 10.1.
 - March 13, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Once a great app, now abandoned.&&&Loved ADW when it first came out, but due to lack of continuing support from AnderWeb made me move onto apex launcher. Need better ICS compatibility.
 - January 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Most Versatile!&&&Offers THE MOST options of all the home launcher apps. Just wish it offered option of vertical dock in portrait mode and horizontal in landscape. Some 3D paneling would be awesome.
 - January 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great&&&Love it, except the wallpaper zoom? When I set an image from my gallery it doesn't display right, fix please
 - May 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Casio G'zOne Commando &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Amazing!&&&I got this application when it first came out, and it's come a long way since it first came out. The stock G'zone Commando UI just blows, but this launcher makes my Commando a phone worth having. Well done!
 - March 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&5 stars!&&&Everything fine, but I'd like for the homescreen layout on xhdpi devices like the Galaxy Nexus fixed. When using a widget like Minimalistic Text that uses large widgets, the widget does not take up the whole screen unless the dock is enabled.
 - December 12, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Love the App&&&Been using the free version 4ever!!! Just upgraded, love it but I miss some of the options in the free version. :-( Will email the options I'm missing
 - March 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Where is the app hide in drawer?&&&Love this but why is it missing the ability to hide non used apps in the app drawer ?  Edit: I just learned about app catalogs ...this is a better way of isolating apps...thanks
 - December 21, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good but little things get irritating&&&Scrolling widgets are choppy and when I leave an app like youtube or the browser it seems to reload all the icons and widgets. Can this be fixed. Galaxy Nexus.
 - December 27, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good app, but...&&&No Dev Response. Great app, but has its hitches and bugs. Redraws constantly. No response from devs after multiple emails = lost stars. Poor customer support never flies with me.
 - April 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Neo V &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Omg&&&You know what I have had adw launcher since day dot.. Brought it when android first come out and forgot all about it and also used it while using CM and been looking for a fast launcher and tired all the rest and remember got this one... I forgot how fast and smooth..
 - January 8, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Dock is not totally hosed.&&&With Launcher Pro+ I can scroll the bottem dock in both directions.  This home I can only scroll to the left.  As another reviewer pointed out it stupidly tries to reposition icons when one is added or removed.  We need to scroll in both directions, set the number of dock icons, and not have it try and auto arrange them when adding or removing icons.  Homescreen also lags now.
 - March 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Ics issue&&&When using hd quality wallpaper, screen turns all black and need to restart adw and picture appears. Does not happen with nova launcher. Any fix? Otherwise the best
 - February 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Fluid and Responsive.&&&This is by far the smoothest interface I have ever used. I was using GO launcher. It was very customizable but slowed speeds down a bit. Most recently it has resulted in major bugs and lag. Made the the switch to ADW.
 - February 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Simply the best&&&I can honestly say that this launcher goes on every new phone I purchase with the ice cream sandwich theme! It makes my phone look amazing and is highly worth the money. Thank you adw ex devs for making me love every android phone I own.
 - February 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Fantastic&&&There are tons of customization options. Highly recommend. Will load options a bit slow if running on older phone like original DROID. Runs very smooth on DROID RAZR.
 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Now my tablet looks unique!&&&Awesome! Now I feel like my tablet reflects my personality. It looks so much cleaner than the stock theme that came with my Asus eee Tab. Only thing is that when changing orientation its a bit slower but no big deal since I mostly use it Horizontally and have no reason to flip to the side.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&great app&&&not sure why, but while using adw launcher, i always got ~10mb free memory than using stock Xperia homescreen.  I'm happy so far with this transition
 - March 10, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Bad performance on Galaxy Note&&&Have been using this launcher for more than a year, but after getting my Note it became laggy. I even see graphical glitches on desktop scrolling (cube inverse effect). Definitely a software problem on the resources Note has. Until fixed, 1 star.
 - April 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Transformer Prime&&&I've never been the biggest fan of ADW Launcher, but decided to give it a second go with my new tablet, because the Hubs UI was very intriguing. In trying to emulate ICS the dev took things that I didn't like about ICS and applied to his latest update (lack of screen real estate on sides). If he was going to take something from ICS I would have liked the better app drawer and widget browser. He's still in Gingerbread mode when it comes to these features. I'm having to hunt for an older version of ADW to get my screen real estate back. There are going to need to be massive improvements before I consider using it on my HTC Desire Z.
 - March 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great App&&&Great App and worth the price, easy to use and set up, Using it on CM7 and my phone seems to be more responsive.
 - December 24, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Not good&&&Never have I experienced problems before...TIL THE LAST COUPLE UPDATES..adw was better than Go launcher, Regina,Zeam, Nemus, now going back to stock launcher Plse...fix new dock option to take off the unlimited icon on dock....hopefully Xmas comes soon.
February 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Best of both worlds&&&Speed and lightness of Launcher Pro with customizability of Go Launcher. Does not eat as much memory as Go Launcher ex. A little buggy on my xperia pro with gingerbread though. Sometimes the desktop will slow to a crawl and i'll have to restart to fix it. Thats why I gave it four stars.
 - January 31, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Poorly featured...&&&When compared to its free (and far more polished) version. Interface looks very messy when editing screens: grids and icons bounce all over the place. I expected far more customisation. Avoid.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Superb launcher...&&&Use on my Photon and IconiaTab. New updates make this far and away the best launcher for tablets. Great work!
 - April 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great Launcher&&&I'm new to the whole android thing...and this Launcher brought me the slick cool UI I was looking for :)
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&I love it. It's so customizable and user friendly. I miss my sense widgets. ...&&&I love it. It's so customizable and user friendly. I miss my sense widgets. However, all the benefits of adw outweigh the loss of those widgets.
 - January 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Really great, but...&&&I love this and all the customisations you can do.  A minor but annoying issue is that when you have landscape format the wallpaper is centred on the top of the wallpaper, (the cross of a T) not in the middle (the middle of a +). This means that a lot of custom wallpapers look a bit odd.   Otherwise I love the customisations possible and the ability to theme and change the icons and descriptions.
 - February 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best launcher.&&&Is by far the best launcher on the Market....nuff said... Galaxy Nexus..
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent foldering/options&&&O love the way folders work/look on this launcher and there are a ton of great options to customize and make it look just like ICS.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Almost perfect!&&&I never say that but after months of the Samsung 7" tab launcher, ADW won my heart. For a great machine, Samsung employes a crappy launcher.
 - March 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Installed on my Lenovo A1-7 tablet&&&Despite a few minor issues, I feel that the ADW launcher has enabled me to  configure my tablet to suit my own personal needs. Please continue to improve this excellent app as  its the best launcher I have found so far.
 - December 30, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Bad&&&Slows lg esteem, no.reply from emails support, i creted folders that worked, then went bad and hid behind dock for no reason. Not worth the lag. Uninstall.
 - December 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Fit &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Galaxy fit&&&Very good Anyone knows how to get those buttons in the fourth picture.......airplane mode, wifi and all of that......better than go launcher ex.
 - March 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Cool launcher, total resource hog&&&I didn't have this problem with the version of ADW bundled with cyanogenmod. If the battery drain issue gets fixed this is an easy five stars. Please fix it!
 - February 24, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Freezes&&&Works great when it works, but is annoying since it keeps freezing up (ANR) causing a FC.
 - December 20, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&What happen to 2nd dock bar?&&&Last update eliminated my second dock bar!!! I know I can use swiping sides, but the other was better for system setups. Examples wifi, 3g, Bluetooth.
 - May 20, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Used to be great :/&&&This launcher was the best. So good that it became the default launcher in CyanogenMod7. Now launchers like Nova and Apex are controlling the 4.0/ICS scene. Try those launcher before using this one if you're running 4.0+. I hope that anderwebs finds some time to update this bad boy to blow nova and apex out the water.
 - January 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great launcher BUT&&&Please provide a confirmation dialogue before creating a folder. It is a much needed feature to prevent accidental folder creation.
 - January 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Worth the price...  More than, really.&&&I payed 10¢ for it, and I feel bad for  not paying full price for it.  Runs well, is very smooth, and I love it.  Motorola ATRIX 4G
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Thunderbolt users&&&Descent update mess this great app up? Try uninstalling and reinstalling seems to be working for me good now.
 - March 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good..&&&Have used for a long time with Android 2.3. Its not so smooth with ICS though. Have now moved to Apex which is very similar but faster & smoother.
 - April 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&The best ICS experience.&&&This launcher gets me closer to TRUE ICS than any other home replacement. Everything is smooth and cool. There is only one problem I have-not when the system closes it/redraws. Which I can normally fix with fast reboot. But other than that, it's perfect!
 - May 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Good launcher&&&Pretty good launcher, but there are better for free, see Go launcher. Needs better transitions and a lower price to compete.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Wow&&&Best launcher i've tried so far, really smooth and many cool and useful features. keep it up!
 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Fast, adds functionality&&&Doesn't bog down devices at all, love dock on droidx (CM7) and xoom (CM9).  Only thing I would love to see added - functionality like the app Multicon, but making it so it isn't a widget (or even if it is) so when you backup with titanium, the screen is restored correctly instead of losing the widget.
 - December 26, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great!&&&More options and tweaks please! Perhaps Catalog labels and smoother Catalog swipe in the 4D drawer. And the ability to make 1 dock icon larger than the others. :-)
 - December 25, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Works great, unless....&&&There is a bug that occurs if you use the drawer option "Horizontal Paginated" while having a large amount of apps installed. The last few pages are messed up and either link to the wrong app or are dead links. 5/5 if that gets fixed.
 - January 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Luv it&&&Works great on my rooted inspire 4g. Running cm7. I've tried all launchers and this is by far one of the best.   Only feature id love to see is a scrolling dock.
 - December 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&The best!&&&I was stuck with a bland 3 icon dock with SprintID as my third icon, which didn't change even after I uninstalled SprintID. Afterwards the button did nothing. Theb came ADW to save the day, giving me a flashy, resource sipping, ultra-customizable bucket of goodnesss. This is how apps ought to be on the Android market and a shininh example of what other programers should strive for. Keep up the good work!
 - December 12, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great Launcher!&&&This is one of the best. Seems like after the most recent update though, i'm getting a lot of screen redraws. Droid Razr stock.
 - May 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&ICS 4.0 - crashes and fonts problems&&&galaxy note user.. after upgraded to 4.0, many of the downloaded fonts are not compatible... the launcher crashes quite often as well...
 - April 9, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Does not funtion properly on 7 inch Tab&&&I loved it on my phone and when I bought a HTC Flyer I really looked forward to using it but the dock will not rotate in landscape mode....it always stays on the left hand edge and looks stupid. Please fix.
 - January 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Too bad...&&&USED to be my favorite launcher, but now it takes too long to activate, force closes constantly, and developer is totally NON-responsive!  ADW Launcher EX is going downhill, while GO Launcher EX is climbing fast!
 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best Home screen&&&I love it.  When things are stable, it is lightning fast.
 - January 18, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Nice, but lacks some features the free version has&&&I tried the free version of ADW Launcher, as I'm sure most people do, and decided I liked it enough to buy the paid version.  The first hurdle was having to set up my home screen again.  There seems to be no way to import settings from the free version into the pay version.  Second hurdle was where you can group apps in the drawer (nice feature).  In the free version, you could switch between groups using arrows at the bottom of the screen.  This seems to be missing in the paid version.  And as some others have mentioned, it would be nice to be able to hide unused apps from the drawer.  In the end, I reverted back to the free version.
 - December 14, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Left go launcher and loving this launcher&&&Its real smooth and easy to use. Just wish could change fonts of icons and maKe folders in the app drawer. Would be perfect then :-)
 - January 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great&&&Great and fastest.  But sometimes the icons will "stick",  won't open the app.  Other than that it is perfect and my chosen launcher
 - December 13, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great customization&&&Good app for customizing your phone. But it doesn't run as smoothly on my phone as the stock Nexus S launcher.
 - March 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Huawei M865 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&The best!&&&I love this launcher its smooth and I can customize alot! Perfect for me cuz I'm super picky with what I put on my screens, this makes it look legit.
 - December 30, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Xperia X10 Mini Pro &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best one out there.&&&Would be great if there were a couple of more transition effects. Like the 'chariot' effect. Otherwise, perfect.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent.&&&Back to five stars. I enjoyed seeing the quick response to community feedback and how any raised issues were quickly addressed.
 - March 18, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Toshiba AT100 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Love this launcher to death.&&&But there is extreme lag on the desktop of the galaxy note. App drawer Is much more fluid, but is still not great. Tablet ui option for high-res phones like the note, hell id donate more for that if it were possible! Have to switch to launcherpro on the note :/ still great on sgsI and thrive tho, never switching those!
 - December 18, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best launcher&&&This is the best launcher I've used so far. Started with stock Sense, went to ADW, and now I love ADW_EX. Super configurable, super friendly.
 - December 22, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.3.3.56&&&:(&&&I can't understand why you removed froyo dock. There is no possibility to keep black background in app drawer?  I loved it before update. Now its just ok.
 - December 21, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great home replacement!&&&This works great! I'm coming from motoblur and this is 10X smoother and it looks great! I highly recommend to all and especially to any motorola phone
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Warning: may cause custimization addiction...&&&Improved performance, longer battery life, and nearly EVERYTHING tweaked by my personal touch/style. ADW made me fall in love with my phone, and realize the potential of android!
 - January 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Eris  &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Smooth&&&Destroys Go Launcher EX on efficient memory footprint, smoothness of transitions, opening speed, etc. Favorite launcher so far
 - March 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Love it...&&&I have always used ADW (Free) for my phone so I had to try his with my new tablet z280 z102 and its the best! even though im running ICS 4.3 the launcher is sweet as a nut, there's loads of settings to use and the App is well built. My tablet is now a plesure to use! Ty. Would be nice if Hardware buttons could be customed!
 - April 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best launcher out there&&&It's fast and extremely customizable. I love this launcher! It does a great job at getting rid of the crappy MotoBlur on my phone. Razr Maxx
 - January 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Happy user&&&I'm enjoying this launcher on my Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1, it gives plenty of way to customize and get creative.  However after updating to version 3.2, the application drawer became quite stuttering. I hope it can be resolved in a upcoming update.
 - December 21, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&I like it,  but don't _LOVE_ it&&&OK,  I come from the MotoBlur world so from what most people say I should LOVE any launcher I try but that's not the case.   Don't get me wrong, I like ADWLauncher EX but I have been having problems with applications disappearing from the launcher randomly (or so it seems).  I found that restarting ADWEX will often fix the problem but sometimes I am forced to reboot the entire phone. I also miss MotoBlur's "Profiles" where I had one setup for work,  home,  vacation with different widgets/apps available.
 - January 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&I love it&&&I'm on the ATRIX 2 so ram ain't an issue with me seeing I'm rooted. the main thing this got 5 stars for is I can hold my phone sideways and the desktop will flip sideways. I've always wanted to do that since I got then phone
 - April 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Most Reliable Laucher&&&I've tried other launchers like Go Launcher but I like this one the best because It never crashes or lags or has trouble launching any apps. Other than its a normal launcher with lots of customization.
 - December 18, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Better battery life?!?&&&An excellent launcher, and so far seems to be saving me battery power compared to the standard launcher. Odd, but a great side effect! SGS2
 - December 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Simply the best!!!&&&Works flawlessly on my Droid Razr! Tried them all and always come back to Adw! Can't be beat!
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great app&&&This app is great! The only issue I have with it is that the dock icons don't stay in the same order when switching from portrait to landscape.
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Play &&& 1.3.3.56&&&The best!&&&No matter what they say or do the best launcher ever! Totally worth the money! Went through all the launchers and this one gwins by far Sony Mini Pro
 - December 15, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Dock...&&&Loved the app, but the new all did nothing but screw up the dock. The dock background space has shrunk, icons aren't centered properly, etc.
 - December 26, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Needs work.&&&Before the last couple updates I would of gave it a 5, but while the new features are neat, it doesn't run as nice and fast and has alot of bugs.   Also icons don't line up right on the dock anymore, too close to the bottom and too close to eachother.
 - April 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Come mucha batería...&&&Me gusta mucho es súper fluido, con efectos y la formas de crear carpetas y como se ven es de lo mejor, lástima que en mi Samsung infuse consuma bastante batería. Cuando lo arreglen tendrá 5 estrellas
 - March 22, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good launcher but serious loss of usability in recent updates&&&Latest update (late 2011) removed a number of very helpful and worthwhile features. Almost no communication from developer since then. Shame really, since this was a top notch launcher at one time.
 - March 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best so far... but&&&Very good launcher, but why it becomes unresponsive on boot for a minute or even could FC on boot if screen is touched few times. Default samsung launcher is frozen by Titanium. Weird annoyng behaviour. The rest are awesome.
 - May 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great but...&&&For some reason stopped working today. Nothing but FCs and is for some reason affecting other apps like the stock messenger app won't send messages. When fixed, I'll give it five stars again.
 - December 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great Launcher&&&This launcher is great. I love it and it's features.  The one bad thing about it is it doesn't do too well on boot up (MyTouch 4G Slide / HTC Doubleshot). It doesn't show most icons (even if installed on phone, not SD) and it hangs with a prompt to Force Close or Wait. Choosing Wait results in a hang loop. A force close usually fixes the issue, and if not an ADW restart fixes it.  This is a pretty annoying bug, since it easily adds a minute or so to boot.  I would really like this issue fixed!
 - June 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO Shift 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Like it&&&Would give 5 stars, but there are two things that don't exist in the paid version that are in the free CyanogenMod 7.1 install version: scatter animation from screen to screen, and setting that allows you to set the action bar background color. I used both of these and was disapointed that I lost something with the paid version.
 - January 23, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Hidden dock???&&&Why?!? Thank God for Titanium Backup...I hope you could be kind enough to return it to the way it was. Really loved that hidden dock Been such a fan I bought the app twice. Now I can't dare update cus the update disregards the previous settings :( and the dork is broken :'( Yay actually thanx I just rediscovered Go Launcher. Pure awesomeness. Bye bye
 - February 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 1.3.3.56&&&John&&&Great application until I purchased spb shell 3d..... I can see some phones becoming a little slow but my samsung mesmerize ran great. Makes for a great smart phone or tablet experience!
 - December 15, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Had to uninstall to get my Asus Tablet to work&&&Took advantage of the .10 special to try out a custom home on my Transformer but had to uninstall to get performance back. Freakishly slow behavior after the app was loaded. Engadget, News 360, and the Launcher all froze and had to force closed. Uninstalled this app and things are working perfectly again. Shame. Hope they fix the problem.
 - June 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Not good&&&There are plenty of better launchers out there. Need something flashy: use GoLauncher. Need something light? Try Zeam. ADW isn't fit for purpose. It's slow, buggy and is updated slower than the Bible.
 - December 18, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&My choice, even on ICS.&&&This is much more functional and configurable than the stock launcher, and the others I have tried, even on ICS. Love that you can hide the dock bar.
 - January 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.3.3.56&&&BEST! bought to support author open-source effort&&&This is just great (I jump-ship from another popular launcher). I love the fact ADW has a sane default, but with heaps of customization configurations for power-users, runs smooth.... and with regular updates (even if it is updates of what's going on). ADW seems to be the launcher that can customize icon/font size relatively easily, good for those who doesn't have 6/6 (or 20/20) vision!
 - December 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Amazing!!!&&&Amazing update!! All of the complainers need to learn how to use and modify through the settings.
 - March 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Slick!&&&Switched over from LauncherPro. I was skeptical but it won me over without effort. Great interface and customization-downloadable  themes make it easy.
 - May 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent just perfect&&&ADW EX it's number 1 the best one awesome I Love it
 - March 4, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&I dunno...&&&This launcher is nice has some good features but I feel the free version balances out the good from here, please update! (Hate to nag but really a lil somethin somethin man) otherwise good launcher. But GO Launcher beats this until features of ex n free version are integrated
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Redraw issue&&&I have been adw launcher for a long time please fix the redraw issue. The program did not have this issue before the refresh of the ui.
 - June 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent&&&Used the free version for a month and loved it. Decided to purchase the full version to support, but was disappointed to discover I could not remove the Bin as I could in the free version. Would be nice to reinstare this function ss I find the bin annoying and unnecessary as we have a remove option built into long press.
 - December 20, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Decent home replacement application&&&Good enough to scrape by on LG Optimus running CM7. Adds a bunch of functionality and customization. Laggy, but not insufferable. Hope to see it get optimized a bit better.
 - January 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Xperia X10 Mini Pro &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Amazing BUT!!!&&&This is a great paid launcher ever.. but 1 star* lose cause new default dock don't look enough good to me...
 - March 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Used to be waaaay better&&&WTF? Seriously man, did you abandon ADW or what? FC's ask the time on my gnex and I've sent about a dozen error reports to you but you still haven't fixed it!
 - January 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Very Nice launcher&&&fast, smooth, quite stable on my Motorola Razr.  However, i have encounter some bug for placing application on my home screen.  - the icon name cannot be show clearly if it is too long, the second line of the text size will be reduced - I renamed the icon name on my home screen and it will renamed to original when i switch off my phone.  Please fix.
 - April 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Dock bar&&&Love this launcher but don't really like the new dock I would like to be able to use the old dock from a few updates ago
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Really like this app.&&&I've been using ADW EX since it was released, and - even though I've tried some of the others  I haven't found anything else that comes close to this one. Smooth, good-looking, and versatile. Top marks for sure.
 - January 9, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Could be better&&&Running on my iconia a500, im a bit bummed I can't use the stock app drawer and the dev doesn't seem to respond to emails since 15 minutes isn't nearly enough time to play with a launcher amd see if you like it. It runs good, but the app drawer options look quite dull compared to stock honeycomb, and altdrawer doesn't cut it either.
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Great Launcher!&&&Nice launcher with lots of features and highly customizable and absolutely love it.    One minor issue: Whenever I update the icon text on the home screen, it sticks until the next reboot. The reboot reverts back to the default app text. For example, for the app "Dolphin Browser HD", I renamed the text to "Browser" and it sticks but when I reboot, it defaults back to "Dolphin Browser HD".  CM7 (2.3.7) ROM on Motorola Triumph.  Any ideas how to fix it or is there a setting that I am missing?  TIA.
 - April 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Formerly HTC Thunderbolt & now Razr Max&&&Great great launcher.. Love the customization.. 2 small issues I hope will be fixed soon.. But nothing to bad.. I will give it 5 stars the moment they are fixed..
 - December 15, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - NEC MEDIAS N-06C &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great!&&&This home alternative totally rocks. Very customisable. I love the gestures part most. Only one flaw is that my phone recognises it as a running app.
 - April 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome&&&I tired all of them and this is the best by far. Could it be possible to have honeycomb look while scowling?
 - March 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy W &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent&&&Love this app. I can customise everything! 5 stars if an option to hide bloatware is added.
 - June 11, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Update&&&Needs update. Crashes couple times a day. Great launcher. Just needs update.
 - May 20, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good, but...&&&Stops refreshing after a few hours, no matter which and how few widgets I use. A frozen clock and calendar are really uncool. I hope it will be fixed soon, or I'll have to look for a replacement. -- Galaxy S, Android/ICS
 - April 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Much better than Touchwiz&&&This launcher made a huge difference for me, I have a Droid Charge. I love the customization. However there is one glitch I've found that someone else posted. Since I received the FP1 update the wallpaper zooms in regardless if i have wallpaper scrolling on or not. Since I normally have pics as my background they all appear washed out and pixelated. Please fix! Only way I know so far is to switch back to Touchwiz set wallpaper and switch back to ADW
 - December 12, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Much better but...&&&Can you please return the expand desktop option when no dock is present? The icons are off center now. Thanks for an otherwise awesome app! :)
 - January 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Arc S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Stable. Efficient.&&&With Open Home 6 I can change the font of the theme but I can't with this. Everything else is excellent. Best launcher out there. Have had it on 3 Android phones (LG Optimus, HTC Wildfire, Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S) . It works well with all of them. No bugs.
June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&galaxy note premium suite&&&how come when i create new icon on my desktop it comes out not the same size as my other existing icons :( and i couldnt make them the same anymore....so i need to delete all of them and create the new one at once
 - December 31, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Love it!&&&Was using Launcher PRO until I decided to try this, now I'm hooked. Fantastic features works well on my G2x. Occasionally lags, but couldn't back to launcher pro.
 - December 13, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Getting worse and worse.&&&I really don't understand how it keeps getting worse and worse with every update. First the new pop-up 4-icon folder, now the annoying dock bar. Really really disappointed. It's a shame that this was once the best launcher of all; now it's full of bugs and short of features. GO Launcher is much much better.
 - January 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Better!&&&I was happy with the new update but it didn't work right on my HP touchpad. This update fixed it! Nice work.
 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Better than all the stock launchers&&&This is great. Touchwiz was bit laggy because of the snapdragon processor in my galaxy s2. ADW fixed that problem. Highly recommend for anyone that hates the stock launcher. SGS2
 - March 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Security Issues&&&Emailed Dev asking why it wants access to my contacts...  Dev never returned Emails!   The App is nice but I cannot find the feature that would require that.  Now if the launcher does then why not respond?
 - May 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Update?&&&Devs gave up? Need scrolling wallpaper.will make everyone happy
 - April 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Needs sorting out&&&For whatever reason the darn thing keeps restarting and taking a while to populate widgets/apps. Rather annoying but will keep in the hope it will be updated soon.
 - December 12, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Good but not perfect&&&Customization options and animations are great. But there are problems with messaging app: doesn't work if put into the dock
 - April 14, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Hit and miss&&&I'm torn because it runs great on my TF201, but is very unstable on my Desire HD. Definitely one of the most customizable launchers, but force closes frequently and is a major resource hog on my phone. Great on my tablet.
 - February 24, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Loved it at first...&&&... but lately it crashes constantly and have to keep resetting it. Gonna start looking at alternatives.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Please fix&&&Very good I love it but one thing why can't I open my HTC widgets HTC inspire please fix
 - May 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Phones without menu buttons.&&&I used to love this launcher but I just got the evo 4g lte which doesn't have a menu button. The menu bar across the bottom ruins it for me.
 - December 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&5/5&&&Bugs fixed. Good app, good developer . 5 Stars .  ( please add horizontal  app drawer looping )
 - April 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Play &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good launcher&&&It's a good launcher but I would give 5 star rating if it wouldn't write empty every time I exit an app, then I have to wait until it loads every thing.
 - January 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great lot of features, but lags behind competitors.&&&Launcher Pro and Go Launcher provide a smoother home screen experience, but ADW takes the cake with its plethora of features. I hope Ander Web can find ways to improve the performance of this great launcher.
 - June 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Phone no longer boots after install.&&&I've installed this launcher before with no problems. Now, after a clean install of CM7, my phone gets locked on the boot animation. Not a boot loop, but the animation just goes on forever until i pull a battery, rendering my phone entirely useless. Until today, I had no idea a phone could be bricked by a launcher. Especially ADW.
 - May 10, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Add scatter from free?&&&Not great on Galaxy Note. Great customization options. Scatter transition from free is missing? No real development for awhile. Needs updates to match I've like Nova launcher. Still one of the best though. Many others are based on it.
 - December 29, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Has some cool options, but slows phone often&&&Buttons are harder to push than htc launcher. Doesn't show number of unread messages on text or email icon on home page. Has some fun options to choose from, though! I like it overall.
 - February 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best Launcher Ever!&&&Been using EX for a year now.Just excelent. Please fix SGS2 wallpaper zoom!
 - March 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy Player &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great Launcher&&&Possibly the best, but a little on the heavy side of things. Takes a little while to recover after closing some bigger apps(laggy). Otherwise,  the best!
 - January 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great on my DInc2!&&&I'd like selections for number of rows and columns in portrait and landscape orientations in "screen preferences," similar to how such selections appear in "drawer settings."  Nonetheless, it's a great launcher!
 - January 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Better than stock&&&I love it. I install this on tablets and phones, and it just works great. I can either make my phone fast and snappy like the Nexus One or smooth and fluffy like an iPhone (lawl, as if amirite?). I love folders and infinite scrolling and column/row adjustment.. I could go on forever - BUY THIS APP.
 - December 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Pretty great&&&Way better than the stock launcher on my Razr. Lets you resize any widget, change # of rows on home screens, and I really like the way folders behave.
 - January 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Outstanding&&&SWEETER THAN SWEET OMG WELL WELL SWEETER THAN COOL I LOVE IT WOW WOW
 - December 12, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Pretty good but....&&&Wish I could use the Sense  Widgets (eg clock/ weather  )that are already on my phone instead of having to download someone's crapped out imitations.
 - December 31, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&So far its awesome!&&&No problems as of yet. Only complaint is that I have to set up my original desktop icons all over again and some of my widgets don't show up.  I had uninstalled it before for that reason, but i Reinstalled it when i found out Motorola wont be updating my 3-month-old atrix.
 - February 17, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&This was&&&such an amazing launcher especially with Android 4.0  . perfect on my Galaxy Nexus.   What Happened to the scrollable dock!!!!!!#and now all the constant redraws when I press home key. Nova Launcher had won me over..
 - December 12, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&App hiding!&&&Please give us the ability to just hide unwanted apps, instead of using groups. In groups we need to manually add any new installed app! Thanks!
 - June 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Buttons for catalog switch?&&&Can we have optional buttons for moving through drawer catalogs like we had in the non-EX version? The reverse-swipe option is too touchy, and it's counter-intuitive. Very good launcher, though!
 - December 24, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great Launcher but...&&&Great launcher, highly customizable, but widget scrolling is a bit stiff with a custom ICS ROM. I know it's ADW because the stock launcher's widget scrolling is fine and I wonder if true ICS device owners have this issue. Aside from that, it's great, definitely worth the money :)
 - December 18, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great&&&Love this launcher, so much to customize and works very well.
 - April 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Replenish &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Update?&&&This launcher hasn't been updated in awhile. It is still realy good but it still has a few bugs ie if you fling an app above the trash can it will be put back on the screen. Still a nice launcher but needs an update.
 - December 13, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Average&&&I got this for 10 cent so I won't really curse or frown or anything. But I prefer go launcher more.
 - March 21, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Nice but....&&&This launcher used to be excellent but too many force close events recently. Really annoying. Locks my phone up for about 3 minutes.
 - January 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Sweet Home replacement&&&I ditched Sense and haven't looked back thanks to this launcher. I picked it up during the ten cents promo and couldn't be happier. It's faster and much smoother than stock.    @BT: You can get more home screens by hitting menu/edit/plus sign
 - March 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Out of date&&&To old to be on the market. Update ha I lost hope. Atrix launcher has most of what I wanted. this was #1 for 2 years.they had a good run.
 - February 20, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&OK but..&&&Good customization and options but it crashes A LOT on galaxy nexus (rooted 4.0.2). Two months and over fifty crash reports later, I uninstalled.
 - March 31, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&No more dev????&&&There are quite a few areas of improvement..  But the Dev seems to be done with the app..  Haven't seen an update for a while now...
 - March 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&revised - Great now.&&&Before, It does not save any of my settings so it was pretty much useless... but I upgraded to GB and do factory reset, and it is working perfectly now. I like it. But please update!!
 - March 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good, but&&&Renamed icons do not stick after reboots and app restarts.
 - December 18, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Much better than the default launcher&&&Brings the power of Android to life by letting you have nearly full control over the UI settings.  I especially like being able to add rows of icons.
 - December 18, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Best Android Launcher&&&By far the cleanest, smoothest, and most intuitive Android launcher out there. Great and easy customization options too. Running on an HP Touchpad.
 - December 19, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Best thing that ever happened to my phone.&&&ADW EX is phenomenal.  CM7 + painstakingly tweaked ADW EX + ICS ADW theme = a truly phenomenal user interface.
 - January 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&stable speedy launcher&&&been using it for 3+ years now? great stability and speed. but its about time for some new features.
 - December 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&GREAT Home Replacement&&&Been using this for a few days now and love it! Folder options are great, much faster than stock home. Down to 2 home screens with everything nicely organized. -DROID X
 - December 19, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&A little buggy on the Galaxy Nexus&&&I loved ADW on my Incredible. There still seems to be a few kinks to work on in the 4.0 ICS version, the most annoying of which is caused by row spacing that keeps randomly changing. My 4x4 icons on the homescreen keep expanding, effectively 'pushing' some icons below the bottom dock. I have to reboot the phone to get it back to normal.  It only happens like twice a day, but it's pretty annoying.
 - February 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO Shift 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Love app i like that u can use the two desk tops only thing ...&&&Love app i like that u can use the two desk tops only thing i wish u could do is have one desk top wall paper for the oem and a difrent one for this
 - March 9, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Horrible piece of crap&&&This app is Crap. Bought it over 2 years ago when it worked. Upgraded to infuse and can't run the program every time I press home the change log comes up and it restarts the whole theme!! Go launcher beats this app by so much in my opinion.
 - March 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great launcher, but the dock bar is a little odd.&&&The launcher is ridiculously fast. Loving it so far. Only have an issue with the dock bar. You can not change the background anymore. And it shifts the entire desktop up with the keyboard showing.  Maybe I have not found where you can disable the dockbar background.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&ICS menu button&&&I wish there was a way to remove the menu button from the home screen on ICS. Does anybody know how to do this?
 - December 25, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Was good now? ?&&&Been running this on galaxy tab for ages and it was great. After last few updates now runs progressivly more slowly and requires proactive reboots. Please fix.
 - December 13, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Can't take away the last star. If I could I would rate 0 stars. ...&&&Can't take away the last star. If I could I would rate 0 stars. This is not what I paid for. Either return the old dock or refund my money. Funny, seems this app is now only10 cents, that's about what is worth now.	Reduced one more star for this update. Now icons on the dock bar are white only. Why do you keep screwing up what was not broken. We want the old dock
 - June 2, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Trying it again...&&&Update: I really like the app, but the screen customizing is poorly executed. Don't shrink the screen to move an icon position. Annoying!
 - December 27, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&I wish I wouldn't have purchased. Doesn't work as well as the free one ...&&&I wish I wouldn't have purchased. Doesn't work as well as the free one although has more options. EVO.
 - January 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best Launcher out there.&&&The reviews are horrible. You can name folders, scroll live wallpapers, hide icons in app list, and completely change the dock around. Look at Adw settings before you comment.
 - January 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Far superior to Launcher Pro&&&I had LPP for over a year but it would keep crashing and having to rewrite itself each time. This does not and I love it! Worth the investment
 - April 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&:(&&&Before upgrading to ICS this was superb, second to none. But now on ICS, my phone is extremely slow and sluggish, taking a long time to load anything, unless I use HTC Sense. Which is a shame because I'd use this over Sense anyday. Please fix devs! I can't report any error codes either! :( HTC Sensation XE.
 - January 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Droid Bionic stock&&&Excellent! Superb! Best supported launcher. Very well built. Developer pays attention to detail.
 - February 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Needs scrolling widgets for ICS&&&Transformer Prime ICS. Overall, very happy with customization, set up a HUBS layout (very cool).  Love the transitions.  It seems to be missing some of the polish of the default launcher, but it's not too bad.  Seems to handle memory fine (6 home screens, plenty of widgets).  The biggest issue is the lack of scrolling widgets.  Fix that, and 5 stars for sure!
 - April 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Crashes my Gnex&&&Love this launcher but it keeps crashing my Galaxy Nexus. Please fix for 5 star.
 - February 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great job!&&&Please continue to develop this app. I've used various versions over the years and have to say you've finally hit a grand slam with this one! Think you can hit another... I do. Looking forward to the continual evolution of this app, thank you.
 - March 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&need my hidden dockbar back!&&&New update removes the hidden dockbar.... why? Please bring it back! I can't believe you have not brought back the dockbar even though so many people have expressed disappointment in the new design... I have waited months running the old version while I waited for this to be corrected... I give up. I will try the new design and if I don't like it I will be moving on to something new. After 2 years of being VERY LOYAL! This sucks! Just make it an option PLEASE!
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Brilliant&&&Slightly concerned with the lack of updates for 6 months but it's still great.
 - December 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great!&&&Experienced some slight scroll lag on the free version, buying Launcher Ex fixed it. Customizable features are great too.
 - April 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Needs an Update&&&Needs better notifications scheme - ADW Notifier has not been updated in ages and notifications work randomly.  Also needs a lock the launcher against accidental changes.
 - December 26, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&overrated&&&i'm finding the go launcher ex much better even it's free
 - January 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3.3.56&&&THE BEST&&&Absolutely cannot get enough of this!  LOVE IT GUYS!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!
 - March 10, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Getting so old and out dated.&&&SSLauncher makes it so easy to do so much more. ADWLauncher has done a great job, but compaired to SSLauncher, ADWLauncher looks like their still perfecting Froyo.  Finally, finally, finally something new. SSLauncher. Uninstalled this and I'm loving SSLauncher ;-)
 - May 11, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&No updates?&&&At first i give this app five stars, that has now reduced down to one star, no updates since December, the developer won't reply to emails, will change this review when things change for the better.
 - January 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Put the scatter transition in here&&&Needs more homescreen transitions like the scatter transition. Needs more frequent updating in attempt to satisfy some customer needs. Other than that 2 thumbs up
 - December 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great launcher replacement&&&Tons of customizations, flexibility, and optional eye candy. Make it fluff or all business. The choice is yours.
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great launcher&&&ADW is smooth, but definately not for beginners. It can he complicated, but once you get the hang of it, ADW is definately a solid app.
 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best Launcher EVER!&&&Love the customization and the dozens of themes people have made for it! Captivate
 - February 9, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Poor&&&Theming is badly implemented. So many features, yet none work properly. Animations are choppy, dock takes ages to load. Infrequent updates.
 - January 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Cool app.&&&Very cool app, had some gripes with the included dock but then I noticed that you can select a separate dock style if you  go to the theme settings.   Awesome thingie, glad I bought it.
 - December 27, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Crashes on Galaxy S2.&&&This launcher worked really well for a while but lately keeps crashing my phone or causing it to reboot. If the launcher is really responsible for the crashes I can't recommend it.
 - December 21, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Hidden dock...&&&Nathanial and HaTeR and many others share my sentiment. Taking away options that keep your users using your product doesn't make good business sense. That and the CONSTANT screen redraw issue not getting addressed is driving me away from adw. It's still a great program, but the direction you're taking it doesn't suit me any longer.
 - April 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Love it!&&&The only gripe I'm having is that scrollable Widgets on the home screen stutter and lag all the time. Please fix this. Other then that, this launcher is amazing.
 - January 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Almost perfect&&&Great customization options. Live wallpaper (Multipicture) works flawlessly. Too bad you can't disable the big dustbin bar on top. I keep deleting my widgets by accident... Asus Transformer
 - May 8, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Missing key features&&&Needs batch folder add, ICS AOKP like app drawer, and different folder options like Apex launcher
 - March 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Simply the best&&&Came from go launcher and haven't looked back. This is the best launcher for my Desire HD performance wise as well as being very customizable and configurable. It has all I need.
 - April 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&faulty messaging icon&&&text messaging icon on the home screen does not work. Please fix. It's been an issue for about a week now. both on the galaxy s 2 and Blaze.
 - December 23, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Folders don't work&&&The folders option is a nice idea, but it doesn't work properly. Everything looks ok for a while but then strange things happen !
 - February 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&absolutely perfect, no issues if system is stable. Please FIX ISSUE with ...&&&absolutely perfect, no issues if system is stable. Please FIX ISSUE with transparent Navigation Bottom Bar for ICS Galaxy Nexus. it's not transparent as it should be and appears to be with other launchers.
 - December 31, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Issue fixed&&&App drawer fixed,  just wish it would update the what's new sooooo that I knew about it.
 - June 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Stratosphere &&& 1.3.3.56&&&A slight lag at first.&&&Also don't care for new folders, but I don't use them anyway. For those who do it would be annoying. I prefer go launcher, which is free.
 - March 1, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&LauncherPro is better.&&&Adwlauncher crash quite frequently on my HTC g2. LauncherPro runs better & smoother on my g2.
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Yes!&&&I love your launcher. 5 starts because your update included the ability to disable dock bar.  Update looks nice cheers
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Undeniably Amazing&&&Fully customizable, extremely functional, absolutely stunning.  I have never been happier with what ADW can provide for me!  A must have for all!!!
 - May 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&No more support,&&&So bored from the lack of a loop scrolling dock or any tabs in app drawer. Apex Launcher is the new star: so smooth, beautiful and an author implementing quickly the features. I migrated to Apex, and hope soon we get all ADW and Go features  Author is away, like LPP before, no more updates and he closed his blog to comments
 - May 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 2 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&what a surprise!&&&this app works MUCH better and waaay faster than the default theme run by my phone.  exhibit2 4g. i set it up as identical as i could and this thing is smoother and faster hands down. should have been bought sooner.
 - July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Still 5 Stars&&&Revisited this after running Apex/GO/Nova since upgrading to ICS..There's evidently no longer any active development, but it's still one of the better launchers. Runs really well on my GT-I9100T.
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best available launcher&&&Near perfect. Need option to hide apps in drawer. Also periodically erases custom text names on home screen apps. Atrix 4g
 - December 13, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good app&&&Slows down my phone some.  HEX Incredible
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&The best launcher&&&Love this launcher, using it instead of the new stock launcher on Galaxy Nexus
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great, best launcher I have used&&&Favorite launcher except I can't change # of home screens
 - December 21, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&No good for android 4.0, excellent for 2.2+!&&&Icons are small and moved to the left. Cannot scale and center the icons. But that only applies for the galaxy nexus. It is fantastic with my HTC  desire!
 - June 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Needs&&&New Updates? Maybe no updates means it doesn't need one.  But we need moar! MOOOOOAAARRR!
 - April 9, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.3.3.56&&&looks beautiful but&&&for some reason it breaks the wallpaper on my evo 3d, it won't let me apply the wallpaper the way it should ... longer then wide
 - December 17, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Launcher keeps restarting&&&No word from developer after numerous contact attempts. Launcher constantly restarts/reloads. On ics on Nexus s
 - March 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.3.3.56&&&dock&&&why can't it have such a nice dockbar like adw.launcher have? when I have standard always visible dock, and an additional one, "pullable"? this is the only reason i switched back to adw.launcher instead of this one, the additional dock is a very handy thing. also folders looks kinda ugly, but the dockbar issue is much more frustrating
 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 2 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome & smooth&&&This is by far the smoothest, sexiest & lightest launcher available. Used Go for a year, which has tons of options, but comes with too much unnecessary stuff. Just switched & I'm hooked! Love this launcher!
 - March 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Fast and stable.&&&I always come back to this launcher. It has a simple uj, not cluttered like others. Has lots of features, very LCD density friendly.
 - January 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Brilliant&&&This app made the Android UI so much better. I recommend this with the Folder Organizer.
 - February 14, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Does not work properly on HTC flyer&&&Half of the desktop is cut off by an ugly black bar at the top. The resolution is also messed up. I Don't think the launcher detects my honeycomb tablet properly. No usable dockbar. It doesn't appear or disappear with any change in settings.
March 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome, But...&&&Could you take away the double tap options for the dock icons, it causes a small delay which is minor but a little annoying. Otherwise by far the best launcher.
 - February 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.3.3.56&&&No developer response.&&&I had the original ADW launcher that came with Cyanogenmod 7.1 and enjoyed it. Had a few issues with it lately and thought I'd try the EX version out. Over all it's great although I'd like some of the screen transitions from the previous version back like "scatter." Anyways, had a few bugs to report and I've sent several emails with no response. Either the dev is on a long, email-less vacation, in jail, is deceased or is ignoring questions. Not exactly a good practice.
 - March 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Fantastic but&&&Widgets are not scroll-able in this launcher. It's not a show stopper seeing how good the launcher is, but please fix it so it gives the complete experience.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&.&&&Epic launcher since first day of release. Faster and more complete than ever.
 - March 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Not very smooth on galaxy note&&&Great features but kinda laggy on galaxy note. Five stars when this is fixed!

I've used adw launcher on several phones to name a few, Crickets Sanyo Zio & Crickets Samsung Galaxy indulge & now on my Sprint Samsung Galaxy S II Epic Touch 4g
 - December 27, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Hated the update&&&I updated to the latest version, it removed the hidden dockbar, and some of the shortcuts I have on it too. I can not hide the toolbar on top like it used to. All and all, I don't like this update at all.   This is my fav launcher app, pls put features back!
 - January 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome!&&&I've used every other launcher on the block.  Once it went on sale, I said "what the heck" and bought it.  It's amazing.  Just sayin'.  If only I had known about it earlier.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Great Dev!!&&&Com`pletely redeemed himself!!  Now with permanent dock removal, very happy once again!!  Thank you!
 - December 25, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Try the others you'll be back.&&&I've tried Zeem and Go but I always come back to ADW. The latest update makes it much better.  The folder management is still kinda awful and you can't assign icons to them or easily find unassigned apps and you have to rename the awful labels on each folder shortcut created. Go get Folder Organizer for that.  If ADW Launcher would recognize Folder Organizer labels it would be perfect.
 - January 2, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Hide that top toolbar!&&&I'll give 5 stars when I can hide that stupid top toolbar thing again.
 - December 31, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Not good for tablets&&&I bought this app a while ago. I was totally in love with version 1.3.3.1 because it place the dock on the bottom of my tablet in landscape mode. However, the developers decided for whatever reason to break the dock in version 1.3.3.55 so it does not recognize when my tablet is in landscape mode anymore. Now the dock stays stuck on the right side. My tablet is not a darn phone! Version 1.3.3.56 has not fixed this. I can no longer recommend this app for tablet owners. I am downgrading to 1.3.3.1 again.
 - January 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Faster&&&So far, I like it pretty well. I used to like Go Launcher but they seem to have screwed it up.
 - December 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Awsome, one of the best&&&home replacement apps ut. Very stable and the dev cares to keep it that way. Ty for such a good app will happily BUY anything from this dev
 - December 29, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good&&&But needs option to sort app drawer by date installed.  all my apps are in messed up order and hard to find quickly... This is a pain plz fix!
 - February 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Better than GO&&&Yeah Go has tons of customized themes but it lags horribly after a while. This is the best launcher by far and worth the $$. Used regular ADW since it came out couple years ago, Awsome work!  Rooted DROID 3
 - December 17, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Great launcher.&&&Love it but. It's not a good idea anymore to replace something that is already perfect. HTC Amaze.
 - January 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Love this app.&&&Have it on my phone and my tablet.  It's better on the tablet but I wanted the same experience on my phone as on my tablet.  Really pleased with this app.
 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&ADW is the best launcher!&&&Been with them since the HD2 CM7 Builds. Won't go anywhere else. All other launchers try to imitate ADW.
 - December 16, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&.&&&Please fix label under the folder to be under the icon & not on top of it, fix bugs. Add more features and ICS 4.0 settings as well. Love it
 - December 21, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great!&&&ADW slams the competition again! The new dock features are awesome. Paginated scrolling plus app drawer persistence makes me a happy camper! Thanks! Please fix scrolling on ICS Widgets, it's the only thing lacking.
 - January 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Replenish &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Samsung replenish&&&Awsome. Way better than the stock launcher. No force closes yet. Love the UI options. Only one problem, it seems to completely shut down my phone at random. I've only had it for around 36 hours and its done it twice. Please fix it so I can get my money out of it
 - January 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good but choppy&&&Customizations are awesome with this compared to Launcher Pro but Launcher Pro was always perfectly smooth. ADW is slightly choppy opening the app drawer and sliding through the home screens. If it was smooth it'd be perfect.
 - May 12, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&No better than free version&&&If i can find out where my cutomization tools are hiding ill chg this to 5 stars for sure. As of now i customized my free version a lot more...should let u try these apps for at least a day b4 u get ur $ back. Most ppl take morw than that to know if theyre gonna like it.
 - March 16, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Abandonware!&&&Dev only showed up when there was google promotion and pretty much castrated the app instead of adding much needed app drawer folders and other popular features. I think he gave up long before that.
 - December 17, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good launcher.&&&Works great, I love the option to hide the dock.  My only concern is for some odd reason my wallpapers become very blurry and distorted while using this.  Other than that, I love it.
 - February 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Very good launcher&&&Very smooth. Go launcher good too but eats up too much memory. This one works better with less memory.
 - December 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Amazing&&&I was never a fan of this launcher until the recent updates, now its totally won me over. It's very fast and the theme support is great!
 - April 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Love it&&&I can get rid of all those crap apps I never use by setting my own apps, so much packed in this app, love it worth the couple of quid...
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome Honeycomb Replacement Launcher&&&ADW EX makes for an awesome Honeycomb replacement launcher. The transitions from page to page are extremely smooth and the app drawer is extremely smooth. There are a ton of customizations so you can tweak things to your liking.
 - January 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Not bad really&&&The scrolling isn't as smooth as LLP, adw is much more stable than Spb shell 3D. I like the customization with adw and need to see updates more often.
 - January 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great&&&Works great lots of options almost to many. A lot faster than the free version. Would have given 5 stars but can't find an option to prevent the zoom out that it dose when moving an icon or widget on the home screen (its entirely possible that it is there and I just over looked it like I said there are a lot of options). I much preferred the old style of moving things. EVO 4G CyanogenMod7 build 256
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Grr&&&Impossible to arrange icons after most recent update. The zoom effect is counterintuitive and annoying. Awesome otherwise.
 - January 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&My new home screen&&&I love the ability to resize widgets and I like how my folders show the apps inside.
 - January 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Some flaws&&&Love it all apart from the folder function. It seems to forget where the files should be, and just put them in a pile on the desktop.
 - February 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LGE Bryce &&& 1.3.3.56&&&LOVE IT!!&&&Love that I can dock 7 apps!
 - June 22, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good job&&&New folders great, dock bar changes pretty good too. Any chance for screen capture function add on?
 - March 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Update&&&If the app changes shouldn't the preview video? (in market)
 - February 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good, but a bit slowish&&&Should be blazing on a Tegra 2, but sadly no.  love everything else about it tho
 - January 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Fantastic!&&&Almost perfect! Would like to see more transitions, options for folders, but awesome!
 - December 16, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent&&&Great features, excellent launcher. Always replaces the default on all my devices.
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best home screen available&&&This is a fantastic app with a really helpful developer... After I emailed with a problem, it was fixed in a new update within a few days!
 - January 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great&&&Much faster than the stock 3.2 launcher, but I miss the widgets preview and even more the menu button on the top right corner. Please add an option to place the menu button on the corner we want.
 - March 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Slow updates&&&No scrolling widgets with ICS. Developer doesn't push updates out. This could be great but it's 3 stars for now.
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Snappy home replacement&&&Wld be so good to be able use the HTC widgets or stock fone widgets. Not just the  google ones
 - January 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&This launcher wins.&&&After using this launcher for well over a year I can safely say that I love it. I find it to be customizable in ways that other launchers can't even come close. Didn't have a problem back when I had the hd2 and haven't had a single problem on the sensation. This is a must have home replacement app.
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Huawei M865 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&I LOVE this so much!&&&This is by far the best home launcher I used. I now love my phone because of this app! I just wish I could change the font on my applications on my home screen. But without that I still rate this app 5 stars. Well worth the money (:
 - May 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Thanks a lot&&&I wanna stayheart milioni ti es thanks to develpors, Milioni of Thanks
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Not too bad but.....&&&Lacks the ability to add folders in the app drawer; shame shame. Could be 5 star if this got implemented. Alas nearly all launchers scrimp with this feature,  hooray for Go Launcher to lead the way.
 - December 14, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&A nice change&&&If you don't want to root & install a custom ROM this is the next best thing. Nice interface that allows for great customization.
 - January 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.3.3.56&&&simply the best launcher, just try it!&&&New folder bubbles are nice, but I would like to switch off the animation (it't too slow, don't want to wait for)
 - April 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Options&&&I have this launcher on both Samsung Epic cellphone and Motorola Xoom tablet.  Force-closes quite a bit on my tablet but not enough where I prefer the stock launcher to it.  Slight delay reaction on my Epic otherwise great option for both devices.
 - December 16, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Galaxy S II&&&.adw is hands down one of the most complete  launchers. doesn't create any slowness
 - April 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Love it&&&I can't stand trying to use any other launcher after using adw.
 - May 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Excellent&&&Fast smooth and mOstly bug free just the odd thing here and there such as the drawer button not always working but apart from that perfect. Would like to see a few more transitions.very good launcher so much nicer than go launcher and launcher pro is too Buggy.
 - March 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Love this!&&&Need to fix issue with galaxy s2 epic 4g touch. Wallpapers are allways zoomed in and look like crap. Please fix
 - June 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Launchers&&&I like adw ex the best but go ex has more options and they are free. I wish adw ex would make more free themes. I like to change the look of my phone frequently and there's more choices with go ex. Also I like the icon sizing with adw. I have bad eyesight and that's one reason I stay with adw.
 - March 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia X10 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Update please...&&&Last one was in december.... i think its time for an update..... Also, make it more steady....it keeps on reloading after almost every action I do. . . . And that's annoying. So all yous gotta do is Update!! Update!! Update!! Update!!
 - January 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best launcher available&&&As a power user this has to be the best launcher, flexible setup and skinning.
 - April 20, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Too slow on startup&&&Gbread always kills the home launcher when it needs RAM so your launcher needs to start and be ready fast. Go launcher is not as feature rich but starts fast.
 - April 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Nice Launcher so far...&&&I really like this launcher. Can you add a fade effect? Oh yeah, one more thing. I don't like that ICS animation when I drag and drop an icon or a widget. It just makes me harder to drag and drop something on homescreen. Please remove that animation.
 - June 8, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&UPDATE&&&come on dude, let's update! I feel like he's on permanent vacation with the 1.500.000 dollars he gained from this app.
 - July 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus&&&I would say this app is great and stable. However, I am giving it a 3 since feedback is being ignored and no updates yet.. Will change my rating once satisfied...
 - December 13, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Disappointed ...&&&Upgraded from free version and I can't say I like the dock.  I loved swiping up to get the hidden dockbar but seems totally missing in this version
 - December 18, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&I love this launcher but...&&&please add a "hide" feature for the app drawer.  This Launcher is way faster than GO is on my transformer but that feature is a deal breaker...
 - April 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Not Worth the 10¢ I paid in December!&&&I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this but decided to try it after it went on sale. FC daily, loads slowly. Have Uninstalled/Reinstalled several times; won't bother to Install again. GO Launcher EX works better and has both more free themes and nice widgets.
 - January 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome Launcher!!&&&This is the best launcher I have used so far in my opinion even better then go launcher very customizable and runs smoother.
 - April 21, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Few things are hard to understand&&&If phone has a screen with high resolution, then setting a wallpaper is difficult, because it gets cropped into some weird resolution, that has nothing to do with screen resolution.    Absence of separate layout options for portrait and landscape mode is another major fault. Interestingly enough there are options for separate drawer layouts, but somehow this has been forgotten for main screen. This forces not to use auto orientation mode.    If these shortcomings will be addressed, it would be the best launcher.
 - December 19, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Better than stock ICS launcher IMO&&&I wasn't a fan of the customization limitations with the stock ICS launcher, adw launcher saved the day!
 - January 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great!&&&Beautiful home replacement for my tablet. Worth the three dollars.
 - December 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Please give us the 2 dock system!!!&&&I enjoyed the old style hidden dock. Duel dock is what brought me here and the options is what kept me here.It's still a 5 star app!! Just gonna have to adapt to the new style and wait it out I guess.......
 - January 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.3.3.56&&&.&&&Its an good app but it seems like the free one has better options. And the grids on the screens is ugly! Please update soon. Back to go launcher ex untill next update.
 - July 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&It keeps crashing!!!&&&This launcher is great. It does everything I want it to and it looks how I like it to. One downside? It keeps crashing!! I send at least 10 crash error reports every day. Please fix it!!!
 - June 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Is there an FAQ?&&&I bought this app but I'm struggling trying to figure out how to use it. First, I cannot find an existing launcher app on my phone (samsung gio) so is that app hidden to me? I never get that screen to choose a launcher.   Some youtube videos have phones with 5 buttons including a home button. I have 3 buttons, none of which is labelled "home".   The default launch is to go to page 3 (???) with 3 scattered app icons.Messaging, Play and Maps? WTF. Why page 3 and why those 3 apps?  I had to uninstall it and reinstall it to get back a functional phone after I played with it and lost most functionality in doing so. I gather it is great app but I need documentation on how to use it.
 - March 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - LGE Bryce &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Would be nice if&&&No landscape dock support for lg revolution.  Need an update.  That was the whole reason I bought it. Can't even get a refund so how about just the update
 - March 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best Launcher Replacement&&&I had been a long-time LauncherPro user, and this one blows LauncherPro out of the water! Far more customizable, less lag, and never gives me any crashes. Definitely worth the price!
 - March 10, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Laggy on Galaxy Note&&&Worked well on my SGS2, but on Note it lags. Stuttering while transition screens and openeing apps. TouchWiz is flawless, but not my preference. Please update for prior rating.
 - January 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Best launcher on Android!&&&Best Android launcher. Used Launcher Pro for a year then tried ADW! Just plain awesome! Man Android rocks. OG Galaxy S.
 - December 31, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Minor bug&&&App drawer does not refresh sometimes which requires me to restart the application to find my newly installed app.  Please fix and 5 stars.
 - February 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Galaxy s 2&&&A good buy. Easy to set up everything your way. Icon resize and color is usefull, and extra screens avoid crowding. Also has option to use icons to go to any, from any, screen. This helps if your doing it with one hand. View full screen live wallpaper too. A good buy.
 - March 18, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Fantastic&&&This app is great...only thing that will make this app better is that if it had more app drawer animations.
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Great launcher!&&&The settings menu is SUPER CONFUSING, but once I figured it out, it does exactly what I want it to and runs very smooth.
 - March 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Sweet&&&Incredible launcher, works perfectly. Needs some new features though, it's getting kinda stale.
 - March 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Works nice enough.&&&Would love to have option where landscape introduces an entirely new canvas.
 - December 20, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good launcher&&&Overall good launcher. Freezes and gets laggy at times. Easy to customize and has a ton of themes. DroidX
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Supporting open source software&&&Free version is excellent and easy to mess around with. Paid for the full version to support the creator and his support for open source software.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Worth it!&&&At first I was skeptical of the paid version of ADW, but I found it to be much smoother than the free version. Plus, its still compatible with all the extras.
 - June 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Great. Icon sizing and text edit FTW&&&Animations broken on jelly bean...no biggie...
 - March 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Lovely!&&&Superb launcher. Install the MetroStation Icon Pack (one of many other available) and see lovely icons ion your screens instead of the regular ones.  Get this app and go through Coldfusion's Youtube Galaxy Note tutorial on how he's done some amazing things with this!  You wont get enough of looking at your phone :-)
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome&&&Actually using ADW instead of stock ICS launcher.  Just hoping for a better ICS "theme".
 - May 17, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Update this already&&&1 star due to lack of updates, it works well but has a few bugs. I paid for this because it was the best but has since been outdone by a few other launchers mainly golauncher which is actually free
 - May 9, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Nice app, but fails without event notification&&&Being able to see unread emails/text messages and missed calls is probably important to most of us. This app does not offer that in any of its' designs or skins. It should mention this in the description.
 - June 30, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Need update to support ICS&&&After updating to ICS icons take 2-3 seconds to load sometimes when loading home screen(says Empty meanwhile).  Add-widget-menu text is not readable.  Could use ICS's Apps/Widget tab.
 - February 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Best 10 cents I ever spent&&&When Google had the specials.  Very capable and fast launcher
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Doesnt work right with lapdock&&&I love this launcher. It works so well. My only problem is it doesnt display right in lapdock mode ( ICS webtop 3.0) (tablet ui) on my droid bionic lapdock.
 - December 16, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good launcher but...&&&Good enuf..  But not good enough to replace launcher pro..  Has great featuers though
 - January 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Super&&&J'ai niaisé longtemps avec les versions gratuites car je déteste payer des apps. Le fait de pouvoir faire des dossiers d'apps seulement en les glissant m'a fait pencher pour la vente.  J'adore.
 - December 16, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Sweetness..&&&Really trick. But causes my phone to restart every now and then. Worth getting until ICS hopefully arrives
 - January 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Play &&& 1.3.3.56&&&I love this&&&Yea go launcher may but this uses less RAM and is way lighter and therefore faster , doesn't need reloading. And is as much customizable as go launcher ex , so uninstall it and leave this page.
 - March 3, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&free version is better&&&lots of visual screw ups, surely not better than Launcher Pro at all, not that fast and not that fluently animated, waste of $$$.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Where's the updates!&&&Go to launcher for years, but lack of updates drove me away.
 - January 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good, but seldom updated.&&&No additional features with EX, unlike launcher pro. Go has more free features. However, it does not tale up add much memory as those, only 9 mb, which is less than Zeam.
 - December 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.3.3.56&&&My favorite launcher. Go Launcher is nice but it is quite buggy.&&&This launcher is nice and stable and quite low on the memory footprint. Wallpaper scrolling is back, and the app drawer icon select bug is gone. Great
 - January 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Features...&&&I love the customization this launcher allows for, especially the easy folder creating. I wish the dock bar would scroll like the pages.
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Awesome Launcher&&&Just switched from Launcher Pro to this. This is by far so much more stable then Launcher Pro. Also this runs very smooth on my Samsung Galaxy Indulge (Not a lot of software run well crap heap of a phone). The only issues I have had with it, where that when I first installed it it made my device slow. I assume that this was because I hadn't removed Launcher Pro, and that ADW Launcher EX & Launcher Pro were fighting for resources. Once I removed Launcher Pro, this became smooth as silk on my device. I can't highly recommend this launcher enough though. Also I wish I could give it more than 5 stars, it is that good!
 - December 12, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Update lost all my desktops.&&&Don't update until dev sorts this mess out. Been an awesome launcher until now. Lost all my backups and icon placements. Uninstalling.
 - June 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Fantastic&&&A fantastic home replacement app. The best in the play store.
 - March 7, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Great, but for a few annoyances&&&Lately I've had to restart it several times a day. It's been forgetting what my default app is for music playlists, for example. It also forgets what some other, seemingly random, app shortcuts point to.
 - April 30, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Id like to see more development.&&&I'd like more memory optimizations, sometimes it can get sluggish.
 - December 27, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Average&&&No amazing features. GoLauncher is much better. Way more customizable and free. Galaxy s2 and ADW is still slightly laggy

Lets you customize nearly everything, allowing you to create your own unique UI. Lets you resize widgets, edit menu colors, choose animations for screen transitions, assign certain functions to gestures...	...and much more; way too much to fit here. Seriously, dig in the settings and you'll be amazed. My only hangup is that using it disables some native widgets, e.g. HTC's Sense widgets (and I love those). If it weren't for that, it'd be a perfect 5. Worth the money, especially on "pure" Android handsets.
 - June 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Was good but..&&&I went back to go launcher, its way smoother,adw needs to get it together..

 - January 5, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Poor support&&&Not as snappy as LP+ this is partly due to not being able to hide apps from the drawer. Also no scrollable dock or swipe gestures. Developer no longer has a valid email. Do not buy. I would recommend go launcher.
 - February 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Slow and laggy on galaxy note&&&There is a micro lag on galaxy note when moving between home screens. Can't enable wall paper hack which supposedly makes it faster. And this seriously lacks folder option inside app drawer which is a must have if u have lot of apps. 3 stars for good customization options but needs improvement for galaxy note
 - March 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&ICS ISSUES TOO......&&&PLEASE fix wallpapers from turning black or shrinking up and bit during screen properly.  Also APPLICATION DRAWER NEEDS WORK. please make the like ICS where one slides left and other pops from behind.  Looks great and correct to original. Great product. I ain't going anywhere!!  THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK!!!!!!!!!
 - March 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.3.56&&&Has definitely improved but leaves lower end processors lagging&&&Works great on the LG Esteem but I can't say the same for my Optimus. One problem I have is that I really wish this launcher used the system window animations.

 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.3.3.56&&&The Best.&&&9 screens. Awesome customizability. This launcher made me love my phone. The option to hide apps in the app drawer by long pressing would be helpful, because I don't use some of the apps that came with the phone & they just cause clutter. I know there's ways around it, but long pressing would simplify things.
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Worth every penny&&&The smoothness of the launcher rivals that of apple. It made my evo 4g not lag!
 - May 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Need some ICS love...&&&Launchers like Nova or Apex have much much smoother scrolling for widgets that's support it. An update to help improve scrolling would be nice. Ex: Pure Messaging and Google+ have some serious lag on galaxy nexus compared to others mentioned above. Plus when development stops for so long they should make it free because of problems that well never get fixed.

 - May 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3.3.56&&&By far my favourite launcher&&&This is, as the review title says, my favourite launcher that I have tried (default 2.3.6, default ICS, GO Launcher, SPB Shell 3D) with a simple setup, great backup/restore facilities (for when you're playing with settings and royally screw something up) and a very slick app drawer.  The only reason this is a 4 star review and not a 5 star review is that the ADW notifier app should be an integrated part of this launcher rather than a separate app - although this may be a cunning ploy by the developer to get 8 stars total instead of a single perfect 5!
 - December 15, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.3.3.56&&&Good but......&&&I've screwed with this launcher for hours, but still slow and choppy! What gives Dev? Guess back to the best... launcher pro plus! Droid Razr!

If I don't see an update to fix the constant redraws it's back to Go for me.  - Droid X 2.3 UPDATE: BACK TO GO. REDRAWS KILL THIS LAUNCHER FOR ME.

Doesn't load widgets, have to restart manually upon reboot. Limited screens, sense UI is choppy like hell, horrible integration w/ Android, interface more and more quirky and I could go on and on and on. Oh, the horror. Getting worse with each yearly update.

Pathetic.
