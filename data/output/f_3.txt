 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.14&&&Great have it on all my Galaxies&&&The best weather and clock widget available.  Looks great on my Galaxy S III and Galaxy Tab 10.1, but on my Galaxy Player 5.0 the original look changes alot when my screen rotate.
 - July 4, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.14&&&Not working with S3&&&No matter how many restarts I do,  the widgets do not appear in the list. Spent money for nothing. Please fix!
 - July 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.0.14&&&4x2 Widget&&&I am on an HTC inspire with a  custom ics rom. The 4x2 widget says its a 5x2 widget and won't fit. 3 stars until fixed.
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.14&&&Fixed all the bugs&&&Finally fixed the clock to display properly on nexus. Choosing weather sources is nice, and complete customization of utility switches is great.
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF300 &&& 3.0.14&&&Looks really good&&&Looks really nice, would be great if you could also include other widgets, i.e. "Schedule display" so I can make my home page look all the same.
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 3.0.14&&&Works great&&&Paired w/ beautiful widget and ADW couldn't ask for more .And the updates just keep getting better.
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.0.14&&&Great looking widgets!&&&Awesome UI!
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 3.0.14&&&Gorgeous and functional&&&Great app, looks great, works great and is super configurable. Well done and well worth a couple bucks
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.13&&&Awesome widgets&&&I got this app when I first got my galaxy nexus and lived it then, and the new 3.0 update has added and fixed everything I felt was missing before. Hands down the best widget app out there. Looks great and almost every aspect of each app is customisable. If you get another widget app you are missing out.
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.13&&&Great but....&&&Decent widgets. Could use better skins. Also I'm not impressed by the switches. The GPS switch brings you to the settings page, instead of toggling on/off. Touching the clock brings you to clock app not alarm like beautiful widgets does. Almost 5 stars.  Recommended for sure.
 - July 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy S Plus &&& 3.0.13&&&Amazing app&&&This is an amazing app. It makes browsing in my phone so much easier and is beautiful at the same time. I would recommend this for all who are interested in changing how your phone looks.
 - June 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.13&&&HD Widgets&&&Waited till after beta version but all the hype for what? I used Beautiful Widgets B4 & will still do so. The weather comes from same source but BW more detailed for me. I can have my own small village & lots of places but for HD only 1 place which isn't my home but another. Village nearby. My post code is apparently 13 miles away . Not interested to have so many shades of colours .
 - June 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&Invasive permissions&&&Why are contact data permissions required when there is no widget for contacts?
 - June 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.13&&&Payed and installed BUT...&&&No matter how many system restarts I do it does not show up in widget list. Samsung galaxy s3. I will change to 5 star if someone can help.. At the moment though I have paid for nothing.
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.13&&&Best clock app&&&If you like changing the look of your clock, this is so much better than B. W. You can customize to your hearts content and the quality of the widgets is excellent. Give it a shot and spend the time to see all of the different things you can do.
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.0.13&&&HD version fixed for Droid X&&&App is fixed and runs on Droid X again.  Reinstalled and all is well.  :-)  Thanks!
 - June 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 3.0.13&&&Great App&&&Very nice looking app. Would be better if it allowed users to download a 2nd copy that could be set to a different location. Other copies always default to 1st location. We have relatives in Sydney and it would be nice to also see their weather on the desktop.
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&Beautiful and FUN!&&&Love the ability to fully customize. But the weather 1x1 widget stays white. The background color changes, but no matter what color I make the "cloud" it stays white. HTC Amaze.
 - June 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.13&&&Update messed up the size&&&Ever since the new "major update" they screwed up the size of the clock. Now it's way too small. It looks weird on my Galaxy Nexus. Why did they do that? Its like taking the engine out of a Ferrari and replacing it with a pineapple! Why? Please fix....-1 star if I could!
 - June 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&Unusable on Sansung galaxy S2&&&Cannot use this since update all widgets cannot be placed on screen even 1x1...says not enough room on Samsung Galaxy SII
 - June 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&Android alarms for clock change&&&Great app, love it. But, why does it call for a system alarm every time the clock changes? It's wakes the phone out of deep sleep and crushes the battery.
 - June 30, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&gggg&&&latest not working perfekt ics 4.04.Drayne my battery and phone freezing.my launcher is nemus launcher
 - June 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 3.0.13&&&T&&&Dose not work on htc one. Just foreclose, uninstall,reinstall still the same
 - June 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&Great app...&&&but the weather alert icon won't go away.
 - July 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&TASTY&&&Man,these widgets are gorgeous. Glassy,classy and yummy-HD Widgets.
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&Great update to a great app&&&I've between using this app for a long time. The only problem that I faced was that to see the weathers of other cities, you had to use the browser. Now weathers of my favourite cities are accessible on the app itself. Great job. Keep on improving.
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 3.0.13&&&Fantastic&&&Great app. Beautiful widgets and awesome customization options. Works perfectly on my droid incredible 2 and my transformer prime.
 - June 29, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 3.0.13&&&ICS / Google Nexus S - Problems&&&This app, when used with the latest Android OS (ICS 4.0.4), presents problems - for us poor users - which is not highlighted or allude to on the pre-sales information.  Instead, we have to have protracted email conversation with the developers - no matters how good the developers are, this 'debugging process' is becoming all to common when load apps on ICS and, it is incredibly annoying!    Update: just got the app working - the install failed to install any widgets... unreliable install.
 - June 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.0.13&&&Needs more switches.&&&What? NO switches for email, fb, txt msg etc., c'mon...
 - June 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&Great Widgets&&&I love these widgets for their customization options.  There are other options, but this one is laid out very well and has a very smooth feel.  My one wish would be the ability to tap the date in the header widget to open my calendar.  There is a setting that suggests that this should be the behavior, but it doesn't seem to work.  Other than that, definitely 5 stars.  Running on an AT&T Galaxy S II with CM9.
 - June 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.13&&&Settings don't change&&&I checked celcius in widget in app settings an it still shows fareheit even when it checked for celcius, c'mon is it that hard.I lucky I have beautiful an premium widgets to rely on instead of this garbage.
 - July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&Beautiful widgets but killing my battery&&&Widgets are so much nicer than beautiful widgets app. Loving July 2012 update.
 - June 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.13&&&Can't sabe what I create.&&&Like other users,  I can't save what I create.  There is no save button.  I noticed that this is the case for everyone with a Galaxy SIII.
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.0.13&&&Great&&&Amazing, all it needs is a callender!!!
 - June 30, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&Buggy since update&&&Clock freezes and widget fails to load on reboot, remove clear data and happens again a few days later.
 - June 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.0.13&&&Dammit!&&&Used to be great but now it has this weird graphics problem around the edges.
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.13&&&Great app recommended&&&
 - June 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 3.0.13&&&Don't work&&&Despite several restarts the widgets do not show up on the homepage. Took longer than the 15min refund period to realize. Paid for nothing.
 - July 3, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&Update&&&Widget does not update, no matter the setting. Must open widget to refresh.
 - June 27, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&clock hangs daily&&&Since last updates the clock stops during the day, every day.
 - June 27, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 3.0.13&&&4x2 still jacked up&&&The clock is incredibly small for 4x2 and 5x2.  So excited to see an update but fix...gs2 skyrocket.  Using nova launcher grid 5x5
 - July 1, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&Doesnt Work on Galaxy S2&&&Keeps saying there is no room for the widget please fix this.
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Live &&& 3.0.13&&&Weather widget fix&&&Thanks
 - July 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&Very nice app&&&Updated to new version. And the new version has lost the data enabled shortcut.  Can I have if back please? It was really nice to have it instead of the airplane mode.
 - June 30, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.13&&&Leong68 Malaysia&&&Very Nice BUT refreshing is very slow. Just one star. Pls update. Seam like nobody care.
 - June 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.13&&&Nice&&&
 - June 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.13&&&GREAT APP BUT....&&&My 1/1 Widgets randomly disappear from my screens. Have to reboot the phone to get them back.  Droid RAZR MAXX
 - June 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&Can't safe my widgets&&&I open the app, go to the down load arrow on the top right, then click on the Glass Gems which then open the widgets for editing, but I can't save them.  The guide says that there should be a save button on the top right, but I can't see one and have tried a number of different ways to save but none work :o(  If anyone knows it please let me know

 - June 29, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&HD?&&&Lame app uninstalling now!!!
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.13&&&Stunning&&&All the extra new looks and options are awesome! Finally I've found a widget I like more than the stock for weather.
 - July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.13&&&.&&&Nothing else even comes close.  Best clock widgets and I've tried them all
 - July 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 3.0.13&&&great on tablet but crashes droid x2&&&these widget have made my Asus tablet much richer but they consistently crashed and locked up by droid x2 phone. had to remove them on the phone. looks like they need some work yet.
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&Fantastic&&&Looks Great, works flawlessly and easy on memory. Best app i have purchased in a while.
 - July 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.13&&&Good...&&&It's very good and nice to look at but it is a bit of a battery monster!
 - July 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.13&&&Galaxy S 4g&&&Best widgets for weather and clocks I have come across.
 - July 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 3.0.13&&&waste of money&&&Lame. No way to save the widget after you configure it so that you can use it on your home screen. The user guide says to press save in the right hand corner, but its not there. Bust
 - July 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.13&&&Doesn't work well with Jelly Bean&&&Toggles doesn't work... fix it please. Thank you.
 - July 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&Hopefully temporary issues&&&Had to uninstall due to excessive battery usage on my Nexus S - almost 30% of my total with wifi and 3g both enabled. I hope it is just bad build...

 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.13&&&Great widget App!&&&Best widget app for time and weather display!!!!
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.13&&&Aweso app&&&Need something like beautiful widgets when clicking on weather icon.. Animations and themes are missing..
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.13&&&Pretty good&&&
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.13&&&Beautiful Widgets&&&Most beautiful weather widget available!
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 3.0.13&&&Better than Beautiful Widgets&&&
 - July 3, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&The new version went down hill&&&Detecting device and changing available widget options to better suit it seems like a good idea. But doesn't work all that well in reality for people using launcher replacements and custom grid sizes. I can't find a decent sized widget now. Therefore I must find a new app which is disappointing since when I purchased this one, it worked great for my needs.
 - July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia S &&& 3.0.13&&&Andy&&&Excellent!
July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.13&&&Superb  !!!  love it.&&&Samsung galaxy s2:  On first use i thought it was very good,but after the HD update i think it is superb.love the choice of clocks and the colours are very good too.also the weather graphics are well done.
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.13&&&Love it&&&
 - July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.13&&&Simply Perfect&&&Gorgeous graphics, very flexible weather provider and system switch provide.   Excellent full size on my tablet.
 - July 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.13&&&Would be better&&&If they would include notification.  They are nice but I can't think of any widget that doesn't have notification except for this one!  Add status bar and notification option and its top dog!
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 3.0.13&&&Beautiful, feature rich widgets&&&Wouldn't want to have a device without it. Use them every day.
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 3.0.13&&&CoolRoo&&&NICE..!
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation XL &&& 3.0.13&&&Comment&&&Super like
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.13&&&Excelent&&&
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.13&&&Glad to have it.&&&
 - June 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&New update.&&&I am having zero issues with the new update. I have used every update to the beta and now the release version and all is fine. Good job!
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Very Elegant Widgets&&&Galaxy Nexus ICS...  At first I had a problem with fonts not fitting in the clock widget, but found that reducing the size of ICS system fonts in the phone settings solved this, and it works great. Developers are good about responding and working hard on improvements.   Excellent job. Love the app. Worth the price. Looking forward to future theme pack  releases.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&Latest update problem&&&Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus with 4.0.4 0n LiquidROM Tried multiple Nexus phones and always get, "No more room on this home screen" when trying to place a widget; even if the screen has nothing else on it.  Widget size doesn't matter either, just won't place. emailed the developer and am hoping he fixes this.  It is a great program, but now I cannot use it. :-(   Update: Developer responded, thank you!  This is because I am using Apex Launcher!  OK, now I'm going to see if Apex can do, or suggest, anything.
 - June 26, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.12&&&Wonderful but...&&&I would love to be able to change the font color of the location and weather details. White doesn't always work. Plus is a HUGE battery drain.
 - June 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.12&&&Poor design&&&As long as this should be beautiful, is not. The clock numbers are not fitted inside the squares, and the combination is far from being beautiful
 - June 26, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.12&&&weather shrunk and clock too big&&&i wouldnt have updated if i knew this would happen. the 5x5 widget has an oversized clock with a disproportionately small weather. i totally hate it. to remedy this, i have increased the # of rows of my homescreen (using a custom launcher) then added a 5x2 header for the clock then added a 5x5 weather only widget. pls fix this in the next update...
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 3.0.12&&&Excellent....and Beautiful.&&&This is how Android ICS should look and work. Quality throughout. Astonishing value. Developers elsewhere please note. This style, if extended to include other existing apps within a unified theme, like the planned Chameleons using Kickstarter, is the way to go. You have the style and skill....android tablets need a uniform page rather than lads of different style widgets. Create a unified page with all selected apps under your stylistic umbrela. Nice.
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&HTC kills the need of this application&&&I Have an HTC phone and I don't need these widgets. None of them are really any better than the stock widgets.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 3.0.12&&&Temp notification&&&Could you please implement a temperature notification option? Only reason I gave 4 stars, its the one thing I miss from beautiful widgets. But otherwise this is way nicer than beautiful widgets almost all around! Thanks for the great development
 - June 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.12&&&Nice Widgets&&&Overall Widgets are nice. Still some kinks need ironing out but a good product.
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 3.0.12&&&Absolutely GORGEOUS!&&&Loving the most recent update! The customization options on this are undeniably beautiful. Love the new font options, especially the much needed Roboto font! Loving this app even more than I already do.
 - June 22, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.0.12&&&This app was great until the last 2 updates&&&Now my 1x1 switches hardly ever show up and my larger widgets disappear a lot.  Droid X.
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Superb!&&&I wanted a 4x1 header widget similar to the one in HTC's Sense 4 UI and HD Widgets gave me that option.  Additionally, there are many other customizeable options to choose for.    Well worth the price and highly recommended.
 - June 26, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.12&&&Battery killer&&&I love the widgets and they enhance my Razr Maxx and my Xoom. Both are running ICS and HD widgets are a huge drain on the battery. Without using it at work, Xoom drained 50%. With them not in use, the drain wS 10 %. The drain was similar on the Maxx. Fix this and I will update the score to 5 stars.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Extremely good! Highly recommended!&&&Takes some effort to master, but has the ability to create beautiful and well designed widgets that are superior to even HTC Sense widgets. Highly recommend!!! Makes my phone look wonderful!
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 3.0.12&&&5 stars&&&5 stars for a worthy widget. A few issues occasionally but support is excellent with quick and courteous responses. Highly recommended.
 - June 28, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 3.0.12&&&-&&&Needs Environment Canada or Google as weather data sources, as Weatherbug and Accuweather are not accurate for much of Canada. No good!!
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.12&&&Awesome.&&&Great widgets and supper. Had an issue with the widgets loading on power up. Only took a day and a couple emails for the updated fix. I love it!
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Excellent.&&&Much nicer than beautiful widgets and fancy widgets. Having the choice of four weather providers is also brilliant. You don't get live wallpaper or weather effects like you do in the others but it makes up for it with low RAM and battery use and the clocks look really sharp on your desktop. It follows your location no problem too. You CAN make your own 4x1 switches, just tap on the top right when selecting the switch and you can pick your own items to show.
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Nice Widget Samsung Note&&&So this widget is pretty sharp, little confusing at first need to follow the on screen instructions before you begin. App is sharp and clear does give you several options to custom color y our widgets individualy for $2.00 its work the price. I would have given 5 stars but the UI is  a little confusing.
 - June 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.0.12&&&Very good again&&&Latest update fixed weather display. Once again it's a solid clock & weather widget.
 - June 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&Need more widgets ....&&&Definitely need more widgets...awesome app otherwise ... just need more variety in widgets...the weather is inaccurate ... doesn't show rain even though its pouring cats and dogs outside ...
 - June 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 3.0.12&&&OK somebody please tell me what I paid for? They're are very few widget ...&&&OK somebody please tell me what I paid for? They're are very few widget and the ones this app has are very ugly and poor quality	There are free apps in the market that look much better then this. I am now removing this app from my phone.
 - June 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.0.12&&&Works fine without ICS!&&&This works fine on my phone without ICS. And its sad that the developer is now recommending it to work.
 - June 26, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.12&&&Slow&&&Awesome widgets but slow scrolling speeds on S3 when scrolling in the widgets tray please fix this soon...
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 3.0.12&&&Hmmm&&&Very nice job finalizing beta. Job well done, everything works and I does have a clock, I think some people need to check the clockpedia to see what one looks like. Thanks for the final release, beta blew big time
 - June 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.12&&&Another update, same bugs still exist&&&Never have seen so many bugs in beta software. I keep reporting bugs and new releases keep introducing new bugs. Unusable at the moment so I am back to beautiful widgets.
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&awesome&&&best widget app,high quality widgets,all customizable...great app!
 - June 21, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 3.0.12&&&4x2 widget no longer works&&&Loved the app before but with the recent update, keep getting a "there's no more room on this home screen" error message even when I have nothing on my screen. Will update my rating when fixed.
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Wooow&&&I recommended a addition and was replyed in a few days and my request was added omg
 - June 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Multiple time zone widgets?&&&Is there a way to have multiple widgets with different time zones?  I only seem to be able to have the local time setting and that's it.
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.12&&&Keeps getting better!&&&Great job with the new updates. Love the app. Keep up the good work!
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&love this&&&Love it:) its app is amazing!
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One S &&& 3.0.12&&&HD&&&This is the best app of its type I have used. The widgets make my HTC one s pop.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.12&&&Xoom cm9 FC&&&FC on xoom running cm9, fix please, thanks.
 - June 21, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&:'( Wish I didn't update to latest&&&I've tried every widget size, and tried resizing, but this latest update shrunk the hell out of the clock and nothing looks right.. On the other hand, the weather fits properly now. All I want is a proper 5x2 or 4x2 clock and weather widget. Hopefully it was just a goof and there's an update coming to fix it.
 - June 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.12&&&Clock rarely updates&&&I like the design and most functions of this app. However,  I have issues with the clock not updating,  currently it is an hour off. this would be a 5* app if the clock worked right.
 - June 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 3.0.12&&&Keeps rebooting!&&&Decided to give it another try after the new updated. Better but still not good enough. I will give 5 stars when my phone doesn't keep rebooting itself because the widget crashes every so often!
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.12&&&Good!!&&&Best!!!
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&please make a date/temp widget&&&please make a date/temperature widget only. Why is clock so necessary when its displayed in the status bar by default?
 - June 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.12&&&Ok&&&4x2 widget does not display properly on a 4x5 screen. Resizing does not work. Will change back to 5 stars when updated.
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.0.12&&&I'd give it five stars....&&&... If you could change the other fonts and text on the widgets.
 - June 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.12&&&New update&&&The new update seems a bit rusty, not all the widgets are centrally aligned anymore. Please fix, cheers.
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&Daniel Walsh&&&Best widgets. Great devs. Unusable at the moment.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.12&&&Liking it.....&&&Only trouble I'm having is when I click on calendar it won't come up
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.12&&&Perfect&&&So far so good with the new update
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&Clock font is too big&&&Overall the widget is great but the clock font is too big.
 - June 22, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 3.0.12&&&Button Control&&&I use a 4by2 widget that has the clock at the top, the date on the left and the weather on the right. The problem is every time I press on the side with the date I get the weather details instead of the calendar. If you press any where near the date the calendar should pop up and this is not happening.
 - June 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Legend &&& 3.0.12&&&Do not buy it..&&&Run the Weather update widget.... And so slow the internet...
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.12&&&still need 4x2 widget on Note&&&the 4x2 widget is no longer supported on Galaxy Note after the update.
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.12&&&NOTE 717&&&Seems like works with multiple dpi
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 3.0.12&&&MUST HAVE!!&&&I had beautiful widgets before this and I was satisfied with it.Saw this and decided to watch the video on it and the amount of customization sold me. For the mere $2.00 its well worth it. No complaints here. Motorola photon 4g.
 - June 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 3.0.12&&&?????&&&Clock not centered on the clock BG and clocks still not working.
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&Superb app&&&I really like this application. There are so many options for weather, time, etc and the quality is bar none. Very glad I bought this one.
 - June 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&Works great.&&&Wasn't a fan of the beta test but it works fine now.
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 3.0.12&&&Really improved!&&&Wow, the new version has been really improved in a lot of ways. However, I want some more toggle switch designs and the process and service needs 10mb of RAM and is constantly active unlike bw which idles as a cached process. Overall, it's a nice collection of widgets!
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Awesome&&&Love it
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.12&&&Good but still needs work&&&The 5x2 widget for the Note works well enough, but the weather part seems broken now.

 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 3.0.12&&&Great app, highly recommended!&&&I originally got this for my Android tablet, as I love the similar features of my HTC phone. Now, after the recent update to version 3, it's also excellent for adding custom switch widgets to my HTC phone.
 - June 23, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.12&&&Not Working&&&Crashes when scrolling through styles as soon as it gets to weather.
 - June 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 3.0.12&&&has clock issues&&&every clock i attempt to use only shows me the 1st number of each like if its 12:30 it will show me 1:3.
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.12&&&Wow&&&You guys worked your butt off on this. Great job!
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.12&&&Gr8 App&&&Really nice customisations for your homescreens. Worth having if you like your phone to be unique-looking. =)

 - July 1, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Ray &&& 3.0.12&&&More bigger&&&It's good looking. But too big, more and more, for widget, up to 15Mb, necessary for me. Even I paid for it, I was uninstall it, and use another 'light' widget
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.0.12&&&Al&&&Excellent!
 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Amazing&&&Once all the hotspots get fixed, pure gold and 5 stars! Awesome customer service too!

 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.12&&&Best weather widget app out there!!!&&&Awesome widget... that is all!!!
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.12&&&Unique design&&&Nice design especially with all grid sizes. But one question to the dev, causes too much wake locks despite setting the update interval to manual.. Why so?
 - June 22, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&Nice widgets&&&Works flawlessly, but drains battery.
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.12&&&Awesome&&&Retracted my previous 1 star. Cleared data and cache. Works flawlessly now.

 - June 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 3.0.12&&&Pretty good&&&A flashlight switch would be useful
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Nice & Clean.&&&Great app. Nice and beautiful widget. Now animated weather is what pending.. ;-)
 - June 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.12&&&Great app&&&More clock styles would be great rather than just different colour versions.
 - June 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.0.12&&&Bug&&&Doesn't add 4x2 widget to a blank screen (not enough room error message) but adds 4x4 with no problem  HTC Inspire 4.0.3

 - June 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 3.0.12&&&Beautiful, but unstable..&&&Before the update,was a lot more stable than this one.
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.12&&&Awesome&&&Awesome
 - June 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.12&&&sucks!!!&&&sucks!!! is not working!
 - June 20, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.10&&&Am I crazy&&&The previews on the 4x2 are different then what actually is on my home screen. The preview looks much better and the weather is larger. I too am bothered being talked down to about this being in beta. I paid for the previous release which was not beta. I did not pay for a beta release. The software should not have been released until it was ready for prime time. 5 or 6 updates later and I still don't think it is as good as the original. Forget about even trying to resize the 4x4. Worked great previously.
 - June 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.11&&&Better than Beautiful Widgets&&&My phone clock says it's 12:49, but my HD Widgets clock says its 12:4.    :'( Please fix
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.11&&&Customizable&&&Good product, quick customer support!
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.11&&&THE BEST&&&Absolutely worth the $$$
 - June 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 3.0.10&&&Good app&&&But I wish the toggles widget was more customizable
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 3.0.12&&&Cool!&&&The best so far.
 - June 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.10&&&i can't have :-(&&&seems to be a power drain and uses alot of space on my crappy Acer. need a decent phone to run but it is very good!
 - June 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.9&&&Like it, but...&&&The reason I bought HD widgets is the switch widget. After using it for a week, I can say that HD widgets, in itself is quite powerful. To hell with the lack of customization, I was able to create a pretty darn cool transparent clock widget with this. But the switch widget in itself is quite disappointing. THAT needs to be addressed. For reference, I am talking about a switch widget like the one with Go Launcher-simple, with lots of customization, and plenty of switches. Would be looking forward for this.
 - June 22, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Sensation XL &&& 3.0.12&&&Poor&&&Meh, not impressed. HTC Sense does the same.. not worth the money
 - June 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.10&&&Great Widgets!!!&&&Great enhancement to my Motorola Xoom interface! New update had me confused for a while, but figured it out. :-)
 - June 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&Love these widgets...&&&I love these widgets.  My only small issue is that on my chosen 4x2 clock/weather widget, the hour number is either left or center justified when it is displaying single digit hours (1:00 through 9:00).  It would be nice if that could be right justified so that it is right next to the colon ":".  This would allow it to match the stock ICS lockscreen when using the ICS clock font.  Otherwise great app.
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 3.0.9&&&Fab, fab, fab&&&Great looking widget, love the fact that if you touch the weather it takes you to the weather app, same as the clock. Also good assistance when there was a problem.
 - June 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 3.0.9&&&Great app even in beta&&&Beautiful app, works really well even though it is in beta. Updated often and relatively few bugs. Well worth the money spent.
 - June 15, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&Look nice, lacking function&&&They look good, and are easy to customize, but on my droid4 the gps, 3G, and 4G buttons just take you to the settings menu. They should toggle those functions, the motorola widgets do, but they are butt ugly! Also it would be nice if the auto brightness and brightness select widgets were the same (add auto to the select)
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.9&&&Great!&&&I had downloaded HD Widgets awhile ago and had always preferred Beautiful Widgets until I tried the recent update of this app. Now I love it and wont go back to B.W. ever! Great update devs and keep the sexiness flowin'!
 - June 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&Nice improvements&&&Very nice improvements in this version.   One thing missing is the ability to re-arrange cities in weather.  Please include that before final release  Tks
 - June 17, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&Beta :(&&&I was very happy with it,until now. It eats battery, and even crashes my system because it freezes. (even restart did not help it). After uninstalling system was running happily again. Where I can get old version back? Thank you p.s. 2 starts for Beta 5 starts old version.
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&big improvement&&&bought this app awhile ago and never used it but now its simply amazing with all the customization u can do,  only need changing color and font in weather forecast and change transparency on Widgets, but with all the updates I'm sure its already in the work's
 - June 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.9&&&Galaxy S2 & Evo 3D&&&Has always been a great app , but with the latest beta update  the weather will not appear on my galaxy
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.9&&&Very good for Beta&&&The widgets a extremely clear on my Galaxy Nexus the only thing I have noticed is the widget is a little small. And at night it shows the sun instead of the moon. Great app!
 - June 17, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&4x3 super clock is gone you suck&&&If I would have known that updating this would break my current setup widgets I would not have updated. I am starting to regret having bought this software. Beautiful Widgets is better and has a free version.
 - June 17, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.9&&&Updates&&&Every time it updates and when i restart my phone i lose the setup. Stop updating so much. And have it save so i dont keep having to configure it.
 - June 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&You broke again&&&After the last update my 1x1 widget don't work HTC rezound ics
 - June 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 3.0.9&&&Battery killer now&&&I have nearly 3000 alarm wakelocks reported with the new version! Almost 3x the next closest app. Battery killer!
 - June 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 2 4G &&& 3.0.9&&&Crap!&&&What the hell? Had this on both my tablet and phone for months and months. Last week the app updated every day and now the sun shows at night and all the widgets have major problems. Turned to crap, probably will go back to Fancy Widgets. I am disappointed.
 - June 21, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Flyer &&& 3.0.9&&&Don't like it anymore&&&I wish could go back to 2.x. It's just too much frosting on the cake. Time to move on. Back to Fancy widgets, maybe.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.9&&&Can't go back ...&&&Simply the best widgets ...hands down.  There is no going back to Beautiful Widgets or anything else.  Worth every penny.  Super responsive developer.
 - June 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.9&&&It seems to be ok&&&I'm happy that the app functions again like it did when I PURCHASED IT...what bothers me is the defensive statement about if you don't like beta blah blah blah. Here is the thing, I didn't pay money for a beta app, and the fact that you were expecting us paid customers to be happy with the way you rolled this out is a bit disturbing. Nevet the less great job with the final outcome and as a result I changed my rating from 1 star to 4.
 - June 17, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.9&&&Nice update but...&&&It has a cleaner, sharper look than the older version with more options than before which is nice and I haven't had any problems/bugs so far on my Droid RAZR. My only issue is why are you reading my contacts now? I paid for this app so I'd appreciate it if developers didn't try to mine and sell every bit of information they can get there hands on. I can't find any explanation on why the permissions have changed so I can only assume that's what's going on. Not cool. 5/5 Otherwise
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus &&& 3.0.9&&&Just keeps getting better&&&I have been using this app since it was first released. The inclusion of themes in ver 3 is much anticipated and is exactly the one thing this app was lacking. If you do run into an issue with this app, the feedback option on the settings menu puts you in connection with the apps devs. The devs are very responsive and they have identified and fixed my few issues very quickly.
 - June 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.9&&&Wow!!&&&Holy crap! Amazing job on the new widgets! They work and look perfect!
 - June 18, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.9&&&Still alpha, not beta.&&&Loved this app until the 3.0 "beta" came along and broke everything.  Beta means testing to make sure nothing is broken.  Typically Alpha, testing to make sure everything at least functions, comes first.  I feel the Alpha stage was skipped.  Repeated updates still have many problems.
 - June 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.9&&&Was great until update.&&&Now it crashes every time I try to place the widget. Please get this fixed. Its the best weather/clock widget when working.
 - June 15, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 3.0.9&&&Clock weather icon&&&The clock  sun doesn't change to dark. If it's already night
 - June 17, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.9&&&Drain battery&&&Last update isn't good.. Iz drains my battery quick.. Fix this please
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.9&&&Perfect.&&&This is working perfectly now and it looks fantastic. If you have a high resolution phone or tablet, download the high resolution icons and use the full screen widget. It looks a treat. Highly recommended.
 - June 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.9&&&The beta version ruined it all&&&JUNE 12 : Sorry to rate it down. Not enough update. My phone looks so ugly now with this buggy widget.   My previous review.  Loving it more everyday.  Not only this is a wonderful app but also it comes from wonderful developer. Their communication is even better than amazon's!!!
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&Superb Widget!&&&So i ve found the most suitable widget for my tab 7.7 :-D
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&@vincent&&&They went to beta without an option to run the regular old version. They have forced us to be beta testers, and it wasn't optional.
 - June 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 3.0.9&&&User&&&It works highly unstable after the last beta-update!
 - June 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 3.0.9&&&Perfect for tablets&&&The recent updates have made a great app even better. I had a brief issue with a bug, but the developer was quick to reply and had a fix up within a day of my contacting him. Count me impressed.
 - June 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&Beautiful&&&This widget app is everything i was looking for and more its by far the best ive ever found great, it will get five stars when its not beta zte warp
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.9&&&Weather?&&&Love the widgets,  but since installing beta,  the weather doesn't show up. Is it looking for a particular weather app?  Motorola bionic.
 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&A+  for tablets&&&Team eos ICS Xoom - this is perfect.  Dev has thought of little things and it works!  It beats the pants off of the other widget packs, no names neccessary!    Pros:  - 15 different widget sizes  - Fully customizable switchboards w/ more toggle choices than the other widget packages  - Select from 4 different weather services  - Hotspots on Clock, Calender, Weather, Forecasts - allows you to launch your own apps.  - Ability to hide unused widget sizes, reducing clutter on your widgets menu  - You built them - infinite color and background options    Cons:  - Seems to continue to update while tab is asleep  - No animation on forecast screen    Despite the tiny drawbacks, this is a must have for tablet owners!
 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.9&&&Loving the new version&&&Tons of customization options and a super easy interface, keep up the great work!
 - June 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.9&&&Latest update broke&&&The latest update broke the ability to refresh when entering the weather app with a stable connection.
 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.9&&&Nice, very nice&&&Bought both Beautiful Widgets and HD Widgets. This is the app I'm sticking with. First, the widgets this app has look amazing. Second, there are so many options! I can get each widget to look exactly how I want it, color coordinating with my background. Third. one purchase, works on both my phone and my tablet! This developer made a very good app and updates are happening, so I know he supports what he made. I don't often give apps 5 stars but in this case they are deserved. Well done!!
 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.9&&&The absolute best widget app!&&&Love the new update. The app has a gr8 feel about it, much more intuitive and user friendly than other widgets. The ability to show multuple locations is gr8!    Also, the dev team is simply supreme when it comes to the speed in which they respond to email!  With prompt personal service like like this, the developers will go far.  Thank you for the gr8 service! (and widget app)  P.S. I uninstalled Beautiful Widgets upon this update.

 - June 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 3.0.7&&&A+ widget app!&&&I've had 'HD Widgets' for awhile now and love it! It's way better looking than the stock weather/clock widget, because you can customize almost every aspect of how you want it to look on your home screen. If you've tried it before and wasn't satisfied, try it again! They have updated frequently and now this app has everything you need, and more. Great job Devs!
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.7&&&Love this app&&&Beta or not, it just works great. Hi-res pack looks simply awesome on my transformer prime. New features in beta just make it that much more worth the price I paid. Great work dev!

 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.7&&&Responsive Developers, Great Program&&&I love the choice of widgets and the ability to customize my own set of switches. Yes, there were bugs (on my Droid, the issues were in the switches), but the developers worked to correct them. Now everything is working perfectly. It's still in Beta, so expect bugs until the finished version is released. That's why it's Beta. If there's a problem, send the developers your feedback so they know the issue and can fix it. And be sure to download the latest version - it may have the fix you were looking for. Can't wait to see more apps from them! Thanks!
 - June 14, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 3.0.7&&&Wrong&&&I don't think paying users should be the testers for your app!

It's still in beta and already blows them away.  Customization, 4 different weather resources, hotspots.  I had a problem last night and developer got back to me within minutes.  Very impressive!  Don't think twice, buy it!

 - June 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.7&&&Great product&&&Fantastic except i would like to be able to have some more customization. For instance i would like to be able to decide what switches go on the switch bars instead of having presets. Also i would love a calender widget and a task/to do widget. However, this is still a fantastic app!
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.7&&&Great app&&&This app has excellent features and designs, as well as very intuitive and easy to understand software. Easily the best app i have ever used.

 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.7&&&Very nice widget app.&&&Extensive customization of widgets places this app at the top. Not only can you change color, background, background type, etc. but you can also change a default 4x2 widget into a 6x4 widget simply by long pressing the widget on the home screen and then releasing.  The support for this app is phenomenal. The developer is very quick to respond to any feedback.
 - June 15, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.7&&&missing 5the day forecast&&&for some reason the 5th day forecast always disappears and the only way to have it back is by reinstalling the app. pls fix!

 - June 14, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.6&&&Beautiful, but quits working&&&Lovely options and beautiful settings.  But visuals don't mean anything if it force closes, stops updating the time/weather, and can't load widget after start up. Uninstalling...may reinstall after a few months so you can get it together.

 - June 14, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 3.0.5&&&Bad update&&&HTC incredible... 1x1 widgets default to weather no matter what is picked
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.5&&&Very nice&&&Would like ability to make my own widget, shape and design.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Fantastic widgets&&&After moving away from my HTC Desire to the Samsung Galaxy SII, I have missed some of the nice widgets that HTC included as part of their re-skinning of Android.  HD widgets, then, was a bit of a revelation as it brought arguably the best-looking, certainly the most configurable widgets to my Android device I have ever seen.  The fact that the widgets have "hotspots", meaning that if you click the date on the widget your calendar opens, etc is very cool too.  All in all I'd heartily recommend this.
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.5&&&Ummm...1 star people...&&&...it is beta!  Great strides on improving your ap.  I liked it before but adapt or die I say.  Well done!
 - June 9, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Admire &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Awesome BUT!....&&&Awesome beta way more customization but only down side is it uses WAY TOO MUCH MEMORY, 50MB!!!!!! That's gonna drain the battery like water runs down the sink. Wasn't like that before. I hope it's like that only because it's a beta. Hopefully..other then that great!!!
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Getting better.&&&I don't write reviews too often, usually only when a POS waste of money app ticks me off but these guys are on to something great here. Great support from the devs. Tons of features. The other well known weather widget used to be my fav but just got replaced. Keep up the great work. HTC inspire 4.0.3
 - June 14, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.0.5&&&Jacked up&&&What the heck nothing works right. DROIDX
 - June 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 3.0.5&&&4x4 not workijg&&&4x4 widget is bugged for go launcher and ads launcher. Please fix. I only use this app with the 4x4 widget .
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.5&&&Fantastic.&&&Lots of updates from developers, gorgeous widgets. Fast and stable. Best app I've bought.

 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Worth it&&&Seems to work well. Some crashes but there's a disclaimer upfront. Would like to see a led light widget and make gas smoother like native power control
 - June 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - LG myTouch Q &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Good,not great&&&Will give it five stars when the current weather becomes animated and the flip clock actually flips. Otherwise I just cannot give this 5stars.
June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great!&&&Great, nice quality graphics and very useful set of widgets. A time saver for me. Would reccomend to anyone.
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&The best&&&The customization in this app in incredible. Blows beautiful widgets and fancy widgets out of the water, I've owned both. Can't wait to see what else they include.
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Awesome widgets&&&This is by far the best weather widget so much customization!!! And its so beautiful. I love it
 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Excellent.&&&I used to use beautiful widgets but got this on sale and it has much better developer support.

 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Latest update is really nice!&&&Always liked HD widgets better than any similar app.. but with latest update they really do look high def! Best clock and weather widget by far.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great appn even for Beta&&&Overall its awesome. On HTC EVO 4G GPS switch doesn't switch GPS off/on it navigates you to another menu to change setting, 4g switch doesn't switch off/on navigates to incorrect menu "mobile network setting" which doesn't have the option for 4g. Works great with GO launcher. Would be nice to have customizable switches and be able to have the option to remove the font under the switch.
 - June 14, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Nice, but...&&&Latest update broke 1x1 switch widgets.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&The team rocks!&&&I have bought many apps, but these people rock. They are so quick to respond to feedback and so helpful and nice. Wish you guys all the best! And yea the widgets are very good. I have bought all the major similar apps from the market and i can say this is right up there in the top bracket. Buy it, you won't regret it
 - June 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&If it helps&&&If it helps im using GO Launcher and the weather widget is replaced with text saying not compatible.    Anyone have the previous APK to revert to for the time being?
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Money well spent!&&&This app is one of the very few I've bought and I can confidentially say it's money well spent! The widgets look wonderful, have really nice functionality and the updates just keep bringing in more good stuff.
 - June 9, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great looking app, even in beta it is good.&&&Love the features. Has issue with 4x2 header and calendar. When I try the hotspot, it will often open weather instead of system calendar.
 - June 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Needs work on Galaxy Nexus&&&The 4x2 and 5x2 sizes don't render completely and some text is cut off. The required resize to make the text show makes the widget too large to be practical. Fix this and 5 stars. Until then Beautiful Widgets wins.
 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great update&&&Tons of new features, very slick. a calendar widgets with agenda would be appreciated
 - June 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Good but a bit battery hungry&&&Great looking app and widget. Works fine. The only issue is that it seems to overly draw on battery, at least compared to Beautiful Widgets
 - June 12, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Desent&&&Would give 5 stars but I want to be able to pick the switches I want and use not have to choose from pre-chosen ones
 - June 13, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Crashes all the time&&&I loved the update but when I try to check the weather it always crashes...
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Text wrapping issues on tablet.&&&There are some issues with text wrapping on switches on the 8x2 large header on my tablet while in portrait mode (mainly the battery switch on the tablet set). Other than that, the app works great!
 - June 10, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Xoom 4.0.4&&&Restarted twice but won't  show up in Widgets section. Patiently waiting and yes I know it's a beta.  Will rate when I can use
 - June 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great widget, but...&&&I downloaded 3.03 last night and had the same errors as everyone and else, and was extremely pleased to see them seemingly corrected in the update to 3.04.  However, during customising of my widgets on my Galaxy 7.7 Tab, the beta seems to have killed my Tw Launcher, forcing me to clear all data and essentially customise my tablet all over again.  I'll now wait until this comes out of Beta, and I'll add it's working fine on my Galaxy SI, great to see how quick the devs are with their work.
 - June 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Looks great&&&Great looks but my weather first work. But I'm fine without it.amazing improvement on clock.
 - June 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Weather no good&&&None of the weather services are anywhere near accurate for Australia. They can't even get the current tempurature right.
 - June 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Nearly there&&&Less FC's since last update 3.04 still can't select high res theme simply wont switch to it. Asus transformer tf101 and HTC Desire tested...otherwise extremely nice
 - June 11, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC One S &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&It's just ok&&&I realize this is a beta but 4x2 weather /time widget does not stay on screen when unlocked.  HTC One S.
 - June 10, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Beta is coming along&&&Before the beta this was perfect and hope it will be again  right now clock digits too big and it freezes, but it is a growing process
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Love it!&&&Works wonderfully! Love all the customization! Htc one x
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Pretty great!&&&The A200 is my first Android device and my first experience with widgets. I never really saw much point in most of them; there is a clock on your screen by default. This one, though, really combines a lot of useful features! Weather, auto-tracking and uses four selectable services. Fully customisable switches, relevant to your particular needs. Hot spots that eliminate the need for 'desktop' shortcuts! My only real complaint, other than the clock being a centerpiece in most widgets, is that the calendar hot spot is really hard to hit. In particular, I am using the wide and tall 10" tablet widget. You've really got to nail that date to bring up the calendar app.
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Very nice!&&&Since I updated, this is now by far the best weather widget out there. it looks amazing! The colors are so vivid & everything seems to be working correctly. Sorry I ever doubted it! The name fits, it's truly HD. Galaxy s. Ben
 - June 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - ZTE Blade &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Very nice&&&I wish it was lite, big memory usage.
 - June 9, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Mixed bag&&&Allows you to change everything except weather icons, and the supplied icons actually look pretty bad on the 4x1 forecast widget.
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Love this&&&Can't wait to see what u guys will do with this in beta and is still a lot better than beautiful Widgets...job well done...oh and please add the flip clock actually flipping would make this unique to other apps
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&HTC THUNDERBOLT&&&Works fine. Recent update fixed all problems. Love the weather widget.
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Love it.&&&Finally a tool that allows you to customize switches to suit your needs. Personally I like a single screen and want all of my information on that screen including weather, time, day and date, etc.... And now I can add and subtract my switches (5 per row) to easily access my phone functionality. And it is still in Beta! Good job guys.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great, love the upgrade&&&Works great now, beta started off a little poor, but really like the upgrades, works fine SGSII, great for customizing
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Samsung Galaxy Note Note v4.0.3&&&I posted a 1 star review before (not having seen the request to give the developer time  to sort Beta issues). The developer's latest upgrade is EXCELLENT!  Thanks John
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Best weather&&&What a beautiful update. Love the new customization.
 - June 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Samsung Galaxy Nexus&&&Using 4.0.4 rooted, 4x1 switch for 4G turns on and off intermittently does not always operate and locks up 3G and 4G data transmission requires reset all time. So far other than that many great colours and options..
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Best widgets for the tablet&&&Pretty but still not quite as pretty as sense. Very useful and great widget bars. I like how you can choose the weather source.
June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&What a shame&&&Waste of money compared to beautiful Widgets.......so sad :(
 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Best homescreen widget set yet!&&&I've gone through several home screen all-you-can-eat widget sets before. Beautiful Widgets, Fancy Widgets Pro, just to name a few.  This is my favorite now. It's not quite as customizable, but it's got more info readily available than any others. Weather forecast is very ICS-looking and they all are visually beautiful.  Recommend.
 - June 10, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Doesn't work ...&&&Doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus with ICS 4.0.4
 - June 10, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Problems w Beta&&&HTC Thunderbolt. After adding Widget (5x1 Android), " Installed Successfully ", then " Home Screen Full - Remove Item to Add Another ", even when screen has no items. Keep up the great work updating this app. Thanks.
 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great so far&&&4x2 widget is cutoff on the bottom on tablet in landscape mode.  Using Asus TF201 with ICS 4.0.3.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great app&&&First I couldn't get the weather properly after the new beta update, but you just need put an empty weather widget on your homescreen and then click on it and add the city, etc.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Top app!&&&No problems on my Galaxy Note & Thrive tablet. Sleek and sexy. Beats the frak out of that other app that costs almost 3 times as much with zero support.
 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Nice app&&&In Moto Xoom 4.04 does not appear the weather! Fix please
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Contemplated Giving 1 Star...&&&Because of too many options and so much customization the beta now has.   JK, this is a massive improvement on an already great app!
 - June 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great app&&&But the high res pack does nothing?
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Awesome app.&&&Awesome app. Works perfect now with Holo Launcher. Thank you much.
 - June 9, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Wish I didn't purchase...&&&It works fine but I already own Beautiful Widgets, which has a far more customization than this app.  I do like the system widgets panel better than the stock one in ICS, but I don't think I'd buy it just for that.  So, if you don't own Beautiful Widgets, this one is pretty cool.  I wish the system bar were actually configurable.  Also, it would be nice if the on off switches on the 4x1 and 1x1 didn't have the lit underscore.  Beautiful Widgets is more configurable and the large clocks can actually stretch
 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Gorgeous!&&&Outstanding clock and weather Widgets!  I loved BW for a few years now, HD has them beat by a mile! Good job!
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Brilliant&&&Finally a developer not ripping us off with widgets ... amazing customization and runs amazingly smooth
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Massive improvement!&&&BETA software people. The Dev has made a massive improvement and they deserve full credit for their effort. Bugs are getting fixed quickly by super helpful and responsive developer galaxy note 4.0.3
 - June 10, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF300 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Not good for tablets!!&&&I loved the widgets before. However, the new ones don't display right on my Transformer Pad.
 - June 12, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Weather info not available&&&Same problem as naveenbalaji: The weather part of the widgets doesn't work at all. This is of no use to me without that. Please fix ASAP.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Doesn't work.&&&So far so good. I wish there were more weather icons aside from the default look.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Very nice but....&&&Very nice and attractive app, functions well. But why does it need permission to access contact and profile data? Update: Emailed devs about permissions and promptly received a response explaining why they were required. Thanks!
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Arc &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&BEST APP!!!!!!&&&This app is one of the best I have ever purchased! It looks and works perfect. I have it on my Sony Ericsson Arc and on my Motorola Xoom. Excellent!!!
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great Job&&&Fast response to any issues, working great again best looking weather and clocks around....
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Love the 1x1 icons&&&I use Beautiful Widgets for my homescreen clock with weather, but I use HD widgets for all my power control icons.  They look much better than BW's and the stock power control widget.  And now there are many customization options for the appearance of your widgets.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Sony Tablet S &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Best widgets in town.&&&These are the best Android widgets. Clock, weather, and lots of switches; and all in HD. With the new version, you can customize the background, color, and size. Highly recommended for phones and tablets. Works great on my Nexus S and Sony tablet S (both with ICS).
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Best Widgets for Tablets&&&I use other widgets on my phone, but these are by far the best for tablets!
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Working again&&&Version 3.0.4 seems to have fixed all the problems I was facing. Thanks for your hard work and fast response!
 - June 13, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&RAM&&&Since I installed beta, i see that main process is taking around 150mb ram, hopefully this will be fixed as a final stable version comes out
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Near perfection.&&&Geeking out on the 4x1 (5 button) custom switches. Took me a little bit to figure out that I could customize it.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Fixed&&&Its working again, thanks
 - June 12, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&No longer works on Atrix 2.&&&I bought this program months ago to use on my Motorola Atrix 2 but after the last update it stated that it was no longer compatible and I that it needed to be removed. How about bringing back the original before this Beta so I can use it for what I bought it for.
June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Word!&&&I like this app. Hope you add live weather animation soon. Can't wait to see what comes out when beta is worked out.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Fantastic&&&Superb
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&live it!&&&Thanks dev for keeping update and address found issues.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Awesome&&&Awesome app. Good for phone, great for my tablet! Keep up the awesome work!!!!!!
 - June 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Fantastic&&&I just wish that the full screen 'weather' view was available as a widget!
 - June 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Nice update!&&&Great improvement since the update on my tablet! App ten times better. Worth using for sure. Now let's hope all works well with the nexus S on ics. If so then full five stars!
 - June 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Good start&&&, I love it overall. 5* when bugs like the weather app freezes are fixed.

 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus Pad &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Love the customization&&&Loving the 3.0 upgrade. The new customization features really allow me to make my home screen the way I want it. Please get the high res pack to work.
 - June 9, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Arc &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Weather not working&&&Weather wont work now in the new version wish I never updated it now as had no problems with this before the update
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Thumsup!&&&Excellent upgrade, far better than the old look. Fascinatingly customizable to the rest of the colour schemes and furniture  of homescreen backgrounds and themes.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Toshiba AT100 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Perfect&&&Very quick action by developers on bugs in beta. Now working perfectly on my android 3.2 tablet. The ability to add locations is very useful.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Awesome&&&Awesomeness
 - June 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Please add a 15 day weather forecast.&&&It would be awesome.
 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Ray &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Fantastic!!!!!&&&Brilliant set of widgets. It'd be great if a future update added things like a message widget and a bookmarks widget.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Samsung Galaxy Note/Asus Transformer TF101&&&A massive leap for Version 3,a great app just got much  better,works brilliantly on both my devices.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Wow&&&Was good before now its just wicked on ics
 - June 13, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Memory hog&&&Using 123 MB as a background processes, needs to be trimmed up big time, making my HTC EVO 3d a little sluggish

 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Precedent &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Great&&&Great weather app but be nice move to SD card. My phone only has 160mb of memery for a prepaid phone
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&AWESOME!&&&I use this app on my Xoom and Droid X! Will there be support for multiple time zones with the clock? I am a ham radio operator and would like the ability to add a "zulu" clock. Great job!
 - June 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&Separate your beta version&&&I like the new version of this, but I suggest next time you create a separate beta app so folks aren't forced into a beta test. I think I could forego the "bleeding-edge" for a month or so while the bugs are worked out. Either way, I like what I see so far.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4 Public Beta&&&support is really 5 star&&&%subj%
